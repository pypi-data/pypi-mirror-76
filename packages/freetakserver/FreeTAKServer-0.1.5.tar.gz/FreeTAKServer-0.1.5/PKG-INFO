Description: # FreeTAKServer
        
        ![the Parrot is not dead](https://github.com/Tapawingo/FreeTakServer/blob/master/docs/FreeTakServer%20specs/FreeTakServerLogo.png?raw=true)
        
        Welcome to the FreeTakServer (FTS) git repository.
        
        FTS  is a Python3 implementation of the TAK Server for devices like CivTAK , WinTAK and ITAK, it is cross-platform and is only dependent on python stdlib libraries. We use the Flask framework for web services. 
        it's free and open source  (released under the Eclipse Public License).
        
        ## Use cases
        FTS allows you to connect ATAK clients to share geo information, to chat with all the connected clients, exchange files and more.
        It intends to support all the major use cases of the original TAK server.

        ## Community 
        This code is currently in *BETA STAGE*
        Check out our roadmap @ FreeTakServer#25 to see what is planned
        If you have any issues don't hesitate to bring it up https://github.com/Tapawingo/FreeTakServer/issues,  as TAKFreeServer is still in the early stages of development.
        
        ### Public instance
        we support a public instance of FTS.
        - download the configuration here
        https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IK1LfPN13EWikHaMyOuDDwIerNGz-Wli
        - use the Import manager in ATAK to import the configuration
        
        ### Tell us what you think!
        to discuss with the developer team
        Use the reddit server

        ## Architecture
        TAKFreeServer uses a MVC pattern, the concept of a COT is described in a set of Domain classes, generated  from the UML model using a Model Driven Architecture approach.
        ![the domain model with all the know objects used by CIVTAK/ wintak](https://github.com/Tapawingo/TAKlib/blob/master/docs/FreeTakServer%20specs/FreeTAKServer%20Model.png?raw=true)
        The target architecture supports also the ability to implement "plugins", thanks to a listener, that is decouple from the main server

        ## Documentation
        under docs, you can find various documents including an UMl model of the model classes involved in a COT event.
        
        ## Requirements
        - Python  3.6 (or better)
        
        ## Installing and using FreeTakServer
        ### Prerequisites
        - Install Python3
        ```
          sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 && sudo apt install pip3` (Ubuntu)```
         ```
        ### install FreeTakServer
        Since version 0.8, FTS supports Pip installation, manual installation can be done with some modifications of the import paths, however we don't support it
        
        ```
          pip install FreeTAKServer
        ```
        
        Optional: check if installation is correctly executed
        ```
        pip check FreeTakServer 
        ```
        
        note under windows it's installed under
        ```
        C:\Users\user.name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\Lib\site-packages
        ```
        
        ## Run FreeTakServer
        
        ### Linux
        
        #### Run Server in console
        
        ```
        sudo  python3 -m FreeTAKServer.controllers.FTS
        ```
        this will start the program in an emulated terminal like enviroment
        ```
        help
        ``` 
        to get a list of other supported commands run the above command
        
        it is recommended to start the server with start_all
        
        ### Windows
        go to the start menu and type cmd to start a command prompt
        open a console with admin rights
        ```
        python3 -m FreeTAKServer.controllers.FTS
        ```
        
        ### Troubleshooting
        if, trying to start FTS you get an error 'package not found'
        ```
        'package not found'
        ```
        navigate to the physical location where the controllers are installed and start the server from there
        
        ## Update FreeTakServer
        if you already installed FTS with pip you can use
        ```
        pip install FreeTAKServer --upgrade
        ```
