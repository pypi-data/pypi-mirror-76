Description: 
        rpmfluff provides a python library for building RPM packages, and
        sabotaging them so they are broken in controlled ways.
        
        It is intended for use when validating package analysis tools such as RPM lint.
        It can also be used to construct test cases for package management software
        such as RPM, YUM, and DNF.
