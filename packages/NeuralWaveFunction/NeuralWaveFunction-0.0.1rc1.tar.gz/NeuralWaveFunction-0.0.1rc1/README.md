# NeuralWaveFunctions

A python module for variatonal Monte Carlo with test functions that happen to
be neural networks.

The implementation was originally forked from
[RNNWavefunctions](https://github.com/mhibatallah/RNNWavefunctions), then
converted to TensorFlow 2, which required heavy modifications, and finally
supplemented with additional features and made into a python module.
