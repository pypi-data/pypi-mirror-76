Description: ########################
        USPS Address Validation
        ########################
        
        ``pyUSPS`` provides a simple client and interface for validating addresses
        using the USPS API. It is mostly taken from 
        https://github.com/BuluBox/usps-api/ 
        
        The only reason this package exists is that not all environment can build
        (or be made to build, or successfully install dated wheels for) ``lxml``.
        So this version uses the native ElementTree implementation in the 
        standard library - no compilation required.
