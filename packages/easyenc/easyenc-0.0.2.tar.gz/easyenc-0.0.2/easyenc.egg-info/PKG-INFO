Description: # EasyEnc, encryption module made for Python.
        EasyEnc is a quick, light and easy module made for Python, to ease your encryption needs.
        
        # Installation Instructions
        Installing this module is as easy as advertised:
        
        **Method 1**:
            You can run `pip install easyenc` in your CMD/Terminal to download and install it
            directly from PyPI (Python Package Index).
        
        **Method 2**:
            You can download the source code from this repository and after that, running
            `pip install "the/path/to/the/downloaded/repo"`
            in your CMD/Terminal and you're done!
        
        
        # Usage and Prerequisites
        Only requirement this module asks for is the Cryptography module which you can install with
        `pip install cryptography`
        
        To use this module, open up a new Python file and type
        `from EasyEnc import KeyGenerator, Encryptor`
        From there, you can create instances of these classes and use the functions inside them, like:
        ```
        kg = KeyGenerator()
        e = Encryptor()
        
        key = kg.generate_key("foobar")
        super_top_secret_message = e.encrypt_message("deep dark secret", key)
        
        print(super_top_secret_message)
        ```
        
        Don't worry you can also decrypt it! But to find out more about it, you can open up a Python Shell and type:
        `from EasyEnc.classes import KeyGenerator, Encryptor`
        and then:
        `help(KeyGenerator)` or `help(Encryptor)`
        
        and Python will display all the available functions along with some documentation included in the source code!
