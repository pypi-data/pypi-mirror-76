        # geo3d
        
        A python package for performing geometric calculations in 3D, such as 
          - coordinate system transformations
          - rigid body motion under local constraints
        
        
        ## Installation 
        To install the module and its core requirements, run
        ```sh
        pip install --user -e .
        ```
        within the base directory. 
        
        To install all requirements, including the ones for unit testing and documentation.
        
        ```sh
        pip install --user -e .[dev]
        ```
        
        ## Usage 
        
        ### Basic usage
        Instructions on basic usage can be found in the jupyter notebook
        `examples/basic_usage.ipynb`.
        
        ### Constrained motion
        The module allows to calculate rigid body movement from disturbances to exact constraints. 
        A usage example is given in
        `examples/constrained_motion.ipynb`.
        
        ## Testing
        Unit tests can be run using 
        ```sh
        pytest -s 
        ```
        in package root.
