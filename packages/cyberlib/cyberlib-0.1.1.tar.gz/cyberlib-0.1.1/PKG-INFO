Description: # Cyberlib
        A cool cyber-security python library.
        
        ## Installation
        
        From PyPI Repository -
        
        ```
        pip install cyberlib
        ```
        
        ## Encrypt
        To encrypt a file using the CLI -
        ```
        cy encrypt [--input I] [--output O] [--passcode P]
        ```
        The input is required for encryption. If a passcode is not provided, it will generate a 32 character passcode for you.
        
        ## Decrypt
        To decrypt a file using the CLI -
        ```
        cy decrypt [--input I] [--output O] [--passcode P]
        ```
        The input is required for decryption. The passcode is required for decryption. If a wrong passcode is provided, the file is locked forever with a random key.
        
        ## YOLO
        You can create a YOLO box (executable file) from any normal file. The yolo executables are designed to accept a passcode and decrypt the data. If the passcode is correct, it will decrypt and present the actual data. However, if the passcode is wrong, it will lock the data with a random key. To create a yolo executable using the CLI -
        ```
        cy yolo [--input I] [--passcode P]
        ```
        The input is required. A 32 character passcode is generated if no passcode is provided.
