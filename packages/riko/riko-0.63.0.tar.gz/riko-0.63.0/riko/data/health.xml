      <title>USC to vet football player's rescue story after doubts: coach</title>
      <description>The University of Southern California plans to vet the story of how one of its football players injured himself rescuing a young nephew from a swimming pool after it received calls questioning the account, head coach Steve Sarkisian said on Tuesday. Josh Shaw, a senior defensive back and team captain, said he suffered two high ankle sprains on Saturday after leaping from a second-floor balcony at an apartment complex in Palmdale, California, to help a 7-year-old nephew who was distressed in a swimming pool. "Within the last few hours or so, we've gotten a few phone calls contradicting what Josh said occurred Saturday night, so we're going to continue to vet," Sarkisian told reporters. Shaw, 22, has been hailed by the university and media for his heroism after his story was published on the USC football team's website on Monday.</description>

      <title>Robotic prostate removal tied to surgical changes, costs</title>
      <description>By Andrew M. Seaman NEW YORK (Reuters Health) – The introduction of robotic surgery for prostate cancer may have led to changes in the number of surgeons performing prostate removals and in the overall cost, according to a new study. With the technology being used more widely, fewer doctors are performing the procedure and the overall cost of prostate removal has gone up, researchers found. While studies examining the benefits and potential harms of robotic surgery have produced mixed results, the researchers write in BJU International that there is little information on how the innovation influenced prostate removal in the U.S. "We knew by anecdotal reports as well as the scientific literature that it had become relatively widespread but we didn’t know how that had been done,” said Dr. Steven Chang, the study’s lead author from Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</description>

      <title>U.S. says non-allergic peanut moves closer to commercial reality</title>
      <description>By Ros Krasny WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new method for removing allergens from peanuts means help could soon be on the way for the roughly 2.8 million Americans with a potentially life-threatening allergy to the popular food, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday. In a blog post, the agency said researchers at North Carolina A&amp;T State University have found a way to reduce peanut allergens by 98 percent to 100 percent by focusing on certain proteins that can trigger food-related anaphylaxis, a severe, whole-body allergic reaction. "We found that treating peanuts with protein-breaking enzymes reduced allergenic proteins," said Dr. Jianmai Yu, a food and nutrition researcher at NC A&amp;T’s School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences.</description>

      <title>WHO urges stiff regulatory curbs on e-cigarettes</title>
      <description>By Stephanie Nebehay and Ben Hirschler GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) called for stiff regulation of electronic cigarettes as well as bans on indoor use, advertising and sales to minors, in the latest bid to control the booming new market. In a long-awaited report that will be debated by member states at a meeting in October in Moscow, the United Nations health agency on Tuesday also voiced concern about the concentration of the $3 billion market in the hands of big tobacco companies. "In a nutshell, the WHO report shows that e-cigarettes and similar devices pose threats to public health," Douglas Bettcher, director of the agency's department on non-communicable diseases, told a news briefing in Geneva. Because they are so new, there is a lack of long-term scientific evidence to support their safety, and some fear they could lead to nicotine addiction and tobacco smoking.</description>

      <title>U.S. names Connecticut official to lead federal Obamacare marketplace</title>
      <description>By David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Tuesday named the head of Connecticut's state health exchange to oversee the federal marketplace that provides subsidized private health insurance to consumers in 36 states under Obamacare. In a move that administration officials billed as an effort to bring new accountability to the federal operation, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced that Kevin Counihan would oversee federal operations, as well as health insurance regulation, in the new post of marketplace chief executive officer. His appointment comes less than a year after the botched rollout of the federal marketplace enrollment portal, HealthCare.gov, which crashed during its launch on Oct. 1, 2013, plunging President Barack Obama's healthcare law into a political crisis for months.</description>

      <title>More parents think their overweight child is 'about right'</title>
      <description>By Kathryn Doyle NEW YORK (Reuters Health) – Between 1988 and 2010, the number of parents who could correctly identify their children as overweight or obese went down, according to a new study. “Today, almost one out of every three kids is overweight or obese,” said senior author Dr. Jian Zhang of the Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro. Zhang and his team examined height and weight data on 2,871 children, ages six to 11, from the 1988 to 1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and 3,202 similar kids from the 2005 to 2010 cycles of the survey. In all cases, the children’s parents were asked if they considered their child ‘overweight, underweight, just about the right weight, or don’t know.’ In the 1988 to 1994 data set, 78 percent of parents of an overweight boy and 61 percent of parents of an overweight girl, identified the child as ‘about the right weight.’ That number increased to 83 percent for boys and 78 percent for girls in the 2005 to 2010 period.</description>

      <title>UK Ebola victim treated with experimental drug ZMapp</title>
      <description>The first Briton to have contracted the deadly Ebola virus has been given the experimental drug ZMapp, the London hospital where he is being treated said on Tuesday, two days after he was brought back from West Africa. British volunteer nurse William Pooley, 29, had been working at an Ebola center in Sierra Leone when he tested positive for the disease. He was flown home on Sunday in a specially adapted Royal Air Force cargo plane and taken to an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. "After careful consideration William decided that he would like to take the experimental drug ZMapp and he took the first dose of the drug on Monday," the hospital said in a statement.</description>

      <title>Nigeria says has 'thus far contained' Ebola, one case left to treat</title>
      <description>Nigeria's health minister said on Tuesday authorities had "thus far contained" the Ebola outbreak that started last month, with only one out of 13 confirmed cases still being treated in isolation in the commercial capital Lagos. Onyebuchi Chukwu said of the other cases that five had died and the other seven had been discharged. The remaining one was the spouse of one of the doctors who treated Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian who brought the virus to Africa's most populous nation. "This is an indication that, thus far, Nigeria has contained the disease outbreak." (Reporting by Camillus Eboh;</description>
