Numerous sources said foreign drones had been seen, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting that &amp;quot;non-Syrian spy planes&amp;quot; had on Monday carried out surveillance of IS positions in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. The surveillance is seen as a precursor to possible US air strikes on jihadist positions, similar to those being carried out in neighbouring Iraq. It comes after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&amp;#039;s regime said on Monday it was willing to work with the international community, including Washington, to tackle extremist fighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description>

The report comes as Apple struggles with declining sales of its 10-inch and 7.9-inch tablets, which are faltering as people replace iPads less frequently than expected and larger smartphones made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other rivals encroach upon sales. Apple has been working with its suppliers for over a year on larger touch-screen devices, Bloomberg cited the sources as saying.

Amy Weiss, a spokeswoman for Kenneth Feinberg, told Reuters that the 107 deaths were among 309 claims that have been submitted so far. Before a claim is deemed eligible, it will be evaluated by Feinberg and his staff to determine whether the ignition switch was in fact responsible for causing a serious physical injury or death. The number of death claims submitted already far exceeds the 13 deaths that GM has officially attributed to the switch, which prompted the recall of 2.6 million vehicles earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description>
