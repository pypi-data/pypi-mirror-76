        # Prepnet
        Reconstructable preprocessor library.
        
        The concept of this library is to be able to save pre-processes as a pickle.
        
        # Do you ever remember this?
        Boss: Hey, what's the difference between the new results and the old ones?
        
        Someone: Well, some preprocesses are different.
        
        Boss: Okay. Let me see the dataset.
        
        Someone: Yes, sir. It's this and this.
        
        Boss: What's the difference two datasets? The value that comes out of the difference is slightly, what's the difference in the preprocess?
        
        Someone: Well, I just don't know.
        
        Boss: Why? The dataset contains a commit idand you're managing source codes with git.
        
        Someone: Even if I knew what version of the dataset it was created from. I would have commented out the details and preprocessed it...
        
        Boss: Hey you...
        
        # Example
        I'm writing...
        
        # Test
        ```shell
        python -m pytest --cov=prepnet
        ```
