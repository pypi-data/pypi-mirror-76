Description: Instaseis calculates broadband seismograms from Green’s function databases
        generated with AxiSEM and allows for near instantaneous (on the order of
        milliseconds) extraction of seismograms. Using the 2.5D axisymmetric
        spectral element method, the generation of these databases, based on
        reciprocity of the Green’s functions, is very efficient and is approximately
        half as expensive as a single AxiSEM forward run. Thus this enables the
        computation of full databases at half the cost of the computation of
        seismograms for a single source in the previous scheme and hence allows to
        compute databases at the highest frequencies globally observed. By storing
        the basis coefficients of the numerical scheme (Lagrange polynomials),
        the Green’s functions are 4th order accurate in space and the spatial
        discretization respects discontinuities in the velocity model exactly. On
        top, AxiSEM allows to include 2D structure in the source receiver plane and
        readily includes other planets such as Mars.
