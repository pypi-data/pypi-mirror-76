GnomeCast
=========

This is a native Linux GUI for casting local files to ChromeCast
devices. It supports:

-  Both audio and video files (anything ``ffmpeg`` can read)
-  Realtime transcoding (only when needed)
-  Subtitles (embedded and external SRT files)
-  Fast scrubbing (waiting 20s for buffering to skip 30s ahead is
   wrong!)

Install
-------

Please run:

::

    $ pip3 install gnomecast

If installing in a ``mkvirtualenv`` built virtual environment, make sure
you include the ``--system-site-packages`` parameter to get the GTK
bindings.

Run
---

::

    $ gnomecast

If you see:

.. code:: python

    AttributeError: module 'html5lib.treebuilders' has no attribute '_base'

This is a known bug in ``html5lib`` (used by ``pycaptions``). Run this
to fix it:

::

    # pip3 install --upgrade html5lib==1.0b8

*Please report bugs!*

Transcoding
-----------

Chromecasts only support a handful of media formats. See:
https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media

So some amount of transcoding is necessary if your video files don't
conform. But we're smart about it. If you have an ``.mkv`` file with
``h264`` video and ``AAC`` audio, we use ``ffmpeg`` to simply rewrite
the container (to ``.mp4``) without touching the underlying streams,
which my XPS 13 can at around 100x realtime (it's fully IO bound).

Now if you have that same ``.mkv`` file with and ``A3C`` audio stream
(which Chromecast doesn't support) we'll rewrite the container, copy the
``h264`` stream as is and only transcode the audio (at about 20x).

If neither your file's audio or video streams are supported, then it'll
do a full transcode (at around 5x).

We write the entire transcoded file to your ``/tmp`` directory in order
to make scrubbing fast and glitch-free, a good trade-off IMO. Hopefully
you're not running your drive at less than one video's worth of free
space!

Subtitles
---------

Chromecast only supports a handful of subtitle formats, ``.srt`` not
included. But it does support
`WebVTT <https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/>`__. So we extract whatever
subtitles are in your video, convert them to WebVTT, and then reattach
them to the video through Chomecast's API.
