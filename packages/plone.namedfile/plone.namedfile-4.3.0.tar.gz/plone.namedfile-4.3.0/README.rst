Introduction
============

This package contains fields and wrapper objects for storing:

* A file with a filename
* An image with a filename

Blob-based and non-blob-based types are provided. The blob-based types
require the ZODB3 package to be at version 3.8.1 or later,
and BLOBs to be configured in zope.conf.

plone.supermodel handlers are registered.

See the ``usage.rst`` doctest for more details.
