        A lazy web-framework based on  [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
        
        
        ## Why use Fantasy
        
        [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a **micro-service** style framework.
        It's awesome.
        
        But micro-service framework often cause another problem,
        that is make the code reusability not very well.
        
        So can we keep the micro-service architecture and also keep code reusability?
        
        that's why we create fantasy.
        
        
        Happy Coding with Flask tech-stack, and keep code reusability.
        
        
        
        ## ChangeLog
        
        before v0.5.x, we don't plan submit a human-readable changelog.
        current is 0.3.x.
        
        and we don't use it in our production level project, 
        just for experiment project.
