        PettingZoo is a Python library for conducting research in multi-agent reinforcement learning. It's akin to a multi-agent version of OpenAI's Gym library.
        
        We model environments as *Agent Environment Cycle* (AEC) games, in order to be able to support all types of multi-agent RL environments under one API.
        
        Our website with comprehensive documentation is [pettingzoo.ml](http://www.pettingzoo.ml)
        
        ## Environment Types and Installation
        
        PettingZoo includes the following sets of games:
        
        * [Atari](http://www.pettingzoo.ml/atari): Multi-player Atari 2600 games (both cooperative and competitive)
        * [Butterfly](http://www.pettingzoo.ml/butterfly): Cooperative graphical games developed by us, requiring a high degree of coordination
        * [Classic](http://www.pettingzoo.ml/classic): Classical games including card games, board games, etc.
        * [MAgent](http://www.pettingzoo.ml/magent): Configurable environments with massive numbers of particle agents, originally from https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent
        * [MPE](http://www.pettingzoo.ml/mpe): A set of simple nongraphical communication tasks, originally from https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs
        * [SISL](http://www.pettingzoo.ml/sisl): 3 cooperative environments, originally from https://github.com/sisl/MADRL
        
        To install, use `pip install pettingzoo`
        
        We support Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, on Linux and macOS.
