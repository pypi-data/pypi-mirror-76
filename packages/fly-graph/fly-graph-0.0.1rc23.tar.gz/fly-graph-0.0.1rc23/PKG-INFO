        Graph library for [**FLY language**](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/FLY-language); it enhances FLY capability by introducing *graph* ADT methods to handle graphs.
        
        It is based on common graph libraries like [JGraphT](https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht) for Java and [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) for Python. **FLY Graph** defines a common API by picking a minimal subset of the intersection of both library features; such features include:
        
        - basic graph creation and manipulation;
        - graph serialization;
        - graph tours (breadth-first, depth-first);
        - connectivity and strong connectivity;
        - directed acyclic graphs and topological order;
        - minimum-spanning tree.
        
        ## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
        
        This library is not intended for stand-alone use in non-FLY project as it is part of FLY language; if you just need a library to handle graphs, just refer to above-mentioned, well-known libraries.
