Print Partner Outstanding Statement
====================================

The outstanding statement provides details of all outstanding partner receivables or payables
up to a particular date. This includes all unpaid invoices, unclaimed refunds and
outstanding payments. The list is displayed in chronological order and is split by currencies.

Aging details can be shown in the report, expressed in aging buckets (30 days
due, ...), so the customer or vendor can review how much is open, due or overdue.
