        ## Introduction
        HYDrologic Remote sensing Analysis for Floods (HydraFloods) is a Python application for downloading, processing, and delivering flood maps derived from remote sensing data.
        This is backend behind the [HYDRAViewer](https://github.com/Servir-Mekong/hydrafloodviewer) Geospatial tool which utilizes many remote sesnsing dataset as possible to provide daily (sometime twice daily) flood maps.

        ### Installation
        
        1. Create a new [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with the required dependencies and activate the environment
        
        ```
        $ conda create -n hydra -c conda-forge python=3.6 numpy scipy pandas requests yaml xmltodict gdal shapely pyproj netCDF4 xarray pyresample geopandas earthengine-api fire
        
        $ conda activate hydra
        ```
        
        2. Install additional packages via `pip` that are not on conda-forge
        
        ```
        $ pip install git+git://github.com/KMarkert/simple-cmr.git
        ```
        
        3. Authenticate the Earth Engine API
        
        ```
        $ earthengine authenticate
        ```
        
        4. Install [Google Storage Utility command-line interface (gsutil)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install) and the setup the `gsutil` environment
        
        ```
        $ gcloud init
        
        $ gcloud auth application-default login
        ```
        
        ---
        **NOTE:**
        
        Make sure your initialize the `ee` and `gsutil` APIs with Google accounts that have permissions to read and write to Google Cloud Storage and Google Earth Engine assets.
        
        ---
        
        4. Download the hydrafloods source code and install the package
         - COMING SOON: the hydrafloods package will be on PyPI in the near future to prevent installing from source
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/servir-mekong/hydra-floods.git
        $ cd hydra-floods/py pkg
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        5. Test to see if the installation was successful
        
        ```
        $ hydrafloods run_tests
        ```
        
        
        ### How-to
        
        To initiate the HydraFloods process use the command below.
        
        ```
        $hydrafloods process atms 2015-07-19 --configuration myconf.yaml
        ```
        **NOTE:**
        Details regarding the command
        
        * hydrafloods      --- call the hydrafloods process to begin
        
        * process           --- start the hydraflood process
        
        * atms              --- specify sensor (see processing.py for details options include: Sentinel2, Landsat, Modis, Viirs, Atms, Sentinel1)
        
        * 2015-07-19       --- specify the date of intrest
        
        * --configuration  --- use the configuration file
        
        * myconf.yaml      --- call the .yaml file that specifies the ROI etc. (see the exampl.yaml for details)
