        ## Philosophy
        
        
        Do you inconvenience yourself keeping track of ***thoughts, references*** and ***TODOs*** while working? Me too! So I decided to do something for us - note-shell.
        
        We need an interactive console client to take quick notes and manage them for us, whether it be a random thought that we come across or a link that we want to revisit later.
        
        This project is built on the grounds of making noting down something (anything) super easy, as well as detailed if needed.
        
        ***NOTE**: It is currently intended mainly for developers, who do not like to part with their termials, and anyone with a basic idea of using **python/pip** should be able to enjoy their experience. **Browser based GUI** coming soon!
        
        ## About
        
        
        `Note-shell` records and manages your notes for you. It is a completely **terminal based** app, which interactively helps you maintain your daily notes.
        
        ***NOTE**: some features may not work as intended in a Windows environment. Feel free to raise issues if you face them😃
