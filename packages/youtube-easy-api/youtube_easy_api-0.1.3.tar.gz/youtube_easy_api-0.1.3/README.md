# An Easy Wrapper for Youtube API 3.0
YouTube is one of the main sources of education, entertainment, advertisement, and much more. This service has so much 
data that one can use to run data science projects or build machine learning products. For example, YouTube video 
comments can be an excellent source of NLP projects. YouTube API enables you to search for videos matching specific 
search criteria but it might be a bit confusing for some people. This library provides you a very easy interface to 
extract Youtube video metadata including title, comments, and stats. Hope you enjoy it. 

**Note-** You must setup your **credentials** before being able to use this library. To learn how to setup credentials,
read this link: [Extracting YouTube Comments with YouTube API & Python](https://python.gotrained.com/youtube-api-extracting-comments/). 
This is an excellent post about Youtube API service, and help you step-by-step configure the credentials. You need to 
enter the `CREDENTIALS_PATH` when you want to initialize the `youtube-easy-api` library. For more information, you can 
look at the examples below.


## Library
The library requires the following libraries:

* google-api-python-client
* google-auth-oauthlib
* google

## Install

It can be installed using pip:
```python
pip3 install youtube-easy-api
```

Make sure the `pip` is upgraded to the latest version. 

## Usage

The library currently support the methods below.

* `search_videos_by_keywords`
* `get_video_details`

You can search Youtube service by passing a `search_keyword` to the `search_videos_by_keywords` method. You will 
receive an ordered lists of videos according to the search configs.

```python
from youtube_easy_api.easy_wrapper import *

easy_wrapper = YoutubeEasyWrapper()
easy_wrapper.initialize(credentials_path=CREDENTIALS_PATH)
search_keyword = 'python'
results = easy_wrapper.search_videos_by_keywords(q=search_keyword,
                                                 part='id,snippet',
                                                 type='video',
                                                 order='relevance')
order_id = 1
video_id = results[order_id]['video_id']

print(video_id)
'_uQrJ0TkZlc'
```

You can also extract the metadata of a video by passing its `video_id` to the method `get_video_details`. 

```python
from youtube_easy_api.easy_wrapper import *

easy_wrapper = YoutubeEasyWrapper()
easy_wrapper.initialize(credentials_path=CREDENTIALS_PATH)
metadata = easy_wrapper.get_video_details(video_id='rdjnkb4ONWk')

print(metadata['title']) 
'The Pink Panther Show Episode 59 - Slink Pink'

print(metadata['statistics']['likeCount'])
285373
```


And, that's pretty much it!
