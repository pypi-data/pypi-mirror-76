        Third-party scheduler user interface for borgbackup.
        
        Features:
        
        * Robust architecture (UI cannot crash scheduler, UI monitors scheduler).
        * Backups to remote and local repositories.
        * Support for repositories on removable and LUKS encrypted devices (mounts
          automatically, handles absence gracefully).
        * Schedule based on custom regular intervals
        * Qt-based system tray icon with schedule overview
        * CLI interface to control and monitor scheduler
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Start scheduler (in foreground; add ``-d`` to daemonize)::
        
            cuteborg-scheduler -vvv run
        
        Check status::
        
            cuteborg-scheduler status
        
        Stop scheduler (interrupts jobs which are currently running; borg can cope with
        that; they will be re-started on the next scheduler invocation)::
        
            cuteborg-scheduler stop
        
        Start system tray icon (starts scheduler if not running)::
        
            qtborg-trayicon
