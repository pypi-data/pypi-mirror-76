# PythonQwt: Qt plotting widgets for Python

<img src="http://pythonhosted.org/PythonQwt/_images/panorama.png">

The `PythonQwt` project was initiated to solve -at least temporarily- the 
obsolescence issue of `PyQwt` (the Python-Qwt C++ bindings library) which is 
no longer maintained. The idea was to translate the original Qwt C++ code to 
Python and then to optimize some parts of the code by writing new modules 
based on NumPy and other libraries.

The `PythonQwt` package consists of a single Python package named `qwt` and 
of a few other files (examples, doc, ...).

See [documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/PythonQwt/) for more details on 
the library and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for recent history of changes.

## License

The `qwt` Python package was partly (>95%) translated from Qwt C++ library: 
the associated code is distributed under the terms of the LGPL license. The 
rest of the code was either wrote from scratch or strongly inspired from MIT 
licensed third-party software.

## Overview

The `qwt` package is a pure Python implementation of `Qwt` C++ library with 
the following limitations.

The following `Qwt` classes won't be reimplemented in `qwt` because more
powerful features already exist in `guiqwt`: `QwtPlotZoomer`, 
`QwtCounter`, `QwtEventPattern`, `QwtPicker`, `QwtPlotPicker`.

Only the following plot items are currently implemented in `qwt` (the only 
plot items needed by `guiqwt`): `QwtPlotItem` (base class), `QwtPlotItem`, 
`QwtPlotMarker`, `QwtPlotSeriesItem` and `QwtPlotCurve`.

See "Overview" section in [documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/PythonQwt/) 
for more details on API limitations when comparing to Qwt.

## Dependencies

### Requirements ###
- Python >=2.6 or Python >=3.2
- PyQt4 >=4.4 or PyQt5 >= 5.5
- NumPy >= 1.5
- guidata >= 1.7 for the GUI-based test launcher

## Installation

From the source package:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Examples/tests

The GUI-based test launcher may be executed from Python:

from qwt import tests
tests.run()
```

or from the command line:

```bash
PythonQwt-tests
```
