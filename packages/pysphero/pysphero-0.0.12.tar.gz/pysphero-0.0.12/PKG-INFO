Description: # PySphero
        [![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pysphero.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pysphero/)
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EnotYoyo/pysphero.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EnotYoyo/pysphero)
        
        This is an unofficial Sphero library for BLE toys.   
        The Sphero protocol is reverse-engineered using the official Sphero Edu application for Android and [this](https://github.com/igbopie/spherov2.js) library. 
        
        > This code is tested only on Sphero Bolt. Probably it will work on the other BLE toys too.
        
        ### Install the dependencies
        For using this library need bluepy and libgtk2.0-dev.
        ```bash
        # apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
        # pip install bluepy
        
        # To use gatt BT stack, install it manually
        # pip install gatt
        ```
        
        # Install
        To install `pysphero` use `pip`:
        ```bash
        # pip install pysphero
        ```
        
        # Example
        ```python
        from time import sleep
        
        from pysphero.utils import toy_scanner
        
        
        def main():
            with toy_scanner() as sphero:
                sphero.power.wake()
                sleep(2)
                sphero.power.enter_soft_sleep()
        
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()
        
        ```
        
        # Tips
        While using gatt, if you are facing connection issues
        ```bash
        # Connection failed: Device does not exist, check adapter name and MAC address.
        ```
        You must check if your BLE device is known on your system list (thanks to bluez-tools).
        ```bash
        # bt-device -l
        ```
        If not, used bluetoothctl to do so.
        ```bash
        sudo bluetoothctl
        Agent registered
        [bluetooth]# power on
        Changing power on succeeded
        [bluetooth]# scan on
        [CHG] Controller AB:CD:EF:12:34:56 Discovering: yes
        [NEW] Device 12:34:56:78:90:AB (your Sphero toy)
        [bluetooth]# exit
        ```
        BLE device list must have been populated
        
        # Unknown
        Packet contains sourceID and targetID. Their meaning is unknown.
