gaspy
=====

Gumnut Assembler written in Python.

*gaspy* is a python-based implementation of Peter Ashenden's Gumnut assembler *gasm* which assembles the machine code to
be used with his 8-bit soft-core *Gumnut*. For more information refer to *The Designers Guide to VHDL*
https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780120887859/the-designers-guide-to-vhdl

*gaspy* was forked from my very first implementation created at the laboratory for digital engineering at the University of
Applied Sciences Augsburg back in 2015.

As of now, *gaspy* support all *gasm* instructions and assembles the same machine code as *gasm*.
