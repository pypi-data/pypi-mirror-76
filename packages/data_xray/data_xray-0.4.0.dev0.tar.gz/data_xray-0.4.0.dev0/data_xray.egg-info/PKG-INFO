Description: =============
        Data-Xray
        =============
        
        Data-Xray provides a Pythonic interface to organization and analysis of
        data, acquired primarily with Nanonis controllers, manufactured by Specs GmbH.
        
        The primary emphasis at the moment is on scanning probe microscopy measurements,
        but most of the analysis applies to other domains of hyperspectral data.
        
        Data organization is achieved through the use of xarray structure - which is 
        an ingenious extension of Pandas phenomenology onto arbitrary dimensions.
        
        Data-Xray draws upon many truly excellent python libraries, for which we as developers
        are phenomenally greatful. 
        
        Installation / Setup
        ********************
        
        Use pip to install the library:
        
            pip install data-xray
            
        
        **Testing**
        
        There are a few ways to run the unit tests.
        
        One option is to use the shell script in the root of the repository
        called *test.example.sh*. Copy it using ``cp test.example.sh test.sh``.
        Edit *test.sh* to include your Cicero API username and password. Then, run
        the tests using ``./test.sh``.
        
        Another option is to edit the ``test/tests.py`` file directly, adding your
        Cicero API credentials where indicated. Doing so will allow you to execute
        tests using ``nosetests`` (if you have the nose package installed), or
        using ``python setup.py test``, or invoking the ``tests.py`` file itself.
