Description: 
        rpnChilada is a command-line Reverse-Polish Notation calculator that was
        first written in C in 1988 as a four-function calculator.
        
        It was rewritten in Python 3 in 2012 and now uses the mpmath library.  It
        was a Python learning exercise for me, and a fun little toy, but when I
        found mpmath, it became really cool and powerful, so props to Fredrik
        Johansson, who did most of the heavy lifting (http://mpmath.org).
        
        rpnChilada gives you the whole enchilada when it comes to playing with
        numbers.  You get math functions, algebra functions, combinatoric functions,
        number theory functions, astronomy functions, physics functions, unit
        conversions (comparable to GNU Units) and much, much more.   There are over
        1000 unique operators.  rpnChilada supports lists, but not matrices.
        
        rpnChilada comes with integrated help, which isn't complete, but has at
        least a basic description of every operator, and over 2000 built-in
        examples.  Help now includes descriptions for constants and units as well,
        although a lot of these still need to be filled in.
        
        rpnChilada also comes with an extensive test suite, which is being constantly
        improved.  Many of the functions are validated against the OEIS.
        
        Version 8 represents a major overhaul of the unit conversion code.  Unit
        conversion is now significantly smarter than it used to be, and intermediate
        conversions are no longer necessary.
        
        There are still bugs, and since it's a one-person side project, progress
        is slow, but bug reports and feature requests are welcome at rickg@his.com.
        
        Note, Windows users will want the Windows-specific wheels for pyephem and
        gmpy2:

        https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gmpy
        
        Linux users will need the development versions of the GMP, MPC and MFPR
        libraries.
        
        rpnChilada can be launched with 'rpnChilada' or 'rpn' in the Python Scripts/
        directory.
        
        For a quick primer on rpnChilada's use, try "rpn help examples".  Please note
        that the OEIS integration and geographic location functions require Internet
        access.
