Description: # Lollygag
        
        Lollygag is a CLI based Task Manager.
        
        ## Core Concepts
        
        ### Tasks
        
        Tasks are the core construct of Lollygag. A task has the following fields:
        
        * __id__ - auto incrementing int
        * __title__ - String
        * __due__ - DateTime
        * __description__ - String
        * __priority__ - Integer corresponding to a priority value:
            * 0 - "low"
            * 1 - "medium"
            * 2 - "high"
            * 3 - "critical"
        * __status__ = Integer corresponding to a status value:
            * 0 - "Open"
            * 1 - "In Progress"
            * 2 - "Blocked"
            * 3 - "Complete"
        
        To add a task, ensure the tasks box has focus (tab / shift-tab to switch focus) and press `ctrl+a`.  To delete a task, press ctrl+d
        
        ### Views
        
        to organize how you navigate your tasks, a user can create arbitrary views that are built using SQL.  To create a view, ensure the views box has focus, then press `ctrl+a`.  There are three fields to fill out:
        
        * __Title__: The title for this view
        * __Query__: The sql query to perform
        * __Sort Order__: An integer used to sort the order of your views. (lower numbers are sorted higher, i.e. 1 is higher on the list than 2, )
        
        #### View SQL Queries
        
        Basic View SQL queries should take the form of:
        ```sql
        select * from tasks where {your criteria}
        ```
        
        Using the available fields from a Task listed above, we can craft a query to filter all open critical priority items due today:
        
        ```sql
        # Open Critical tasks due today (sqlite)
        select * from tasks where priority = 3 and date(due) = date('now') and status = 0
        ```
        
        ### Other shortcuts
        
        * To save a task or view without needing to tab to ok, `ctrl+s`
        * to abandon editing or creating a view or task, `ctrl+w`
        * `ctrl+c` to quit
