"""
For the provided DCC record identifiers, PATCHES each record's indicated property with the provided
value. This only makes sense to use when all records under consideration share the same property to
PATCH. But for ease of use, 422 server responses are caught; i.e. the kind with the description of

  "Additional properties are not allowed ('award' was unexpected)" 

which would mean that you are trying to PATCH a property that doesn't exist for the given record type,
and there will be no further processing of the offending record. This check is put into place rather
than just allowing the program to break execution since sometimes it's easiest to let the user provide
a mixed jumble of record identifiers where most of which need to be updated. For example, I once
POSTED a whole slew of record types with a defunct value for the award property. Some profiles don't
have this property, such as replicate. It was easy for me to just feed in the IDs for all POSTED records
and have this program fix any which one that had the award property defined and ignore the rest.
