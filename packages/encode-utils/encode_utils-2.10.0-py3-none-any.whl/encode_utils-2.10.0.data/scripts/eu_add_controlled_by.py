"""Sets the `File.controlled_by` property for all FASTQ File records on an Experiment.

An experiment can have multiple controls. This script will only work if:

  1. The `Experiment.possible_controls` is already set, and
  2. If more than one control, all controls have the same number of biologoical replicates, and
  3. The number of biological replicates on the Experiment is the same as the number of biological
     replicates for any given control.

Having varying number of technical replicates is fine.

These requiements are set in order to have some meaningful, automated way of assigning control
FASTQ files to experimental FASTQ files.

The algorithm works as follows:

  1. The biological replicate numbers on the experiment are stored in a `list`, and ordered from least to greatest.
  2. The biological replicate numbers on each control are stored in a `list`, and ordered from least to greatest.
  3. Biological Replicate Assignment: For each control, its biological replicate number `list` created in
     step 2 is superimposed onto the `list` created in step 1. Assignment then takes place by
     positional matching. The matching is positional instead of simply by biological replicate number
     itself, since the numbering is known in some cases to not alwasy be sequential starting from 1.
  4. Setting `possible_controls`: For each replicate in the Experiment, the forward reads FASTQ file
     linked to that replicate is assigned to the forward reads control FASTQ files. The control FASTQs
     are determined from the superimposition step above. For each control, all replicates that have
     the same `biologican_replicate_number` are included. If the sequencing is paired-end, then
     the same type of assignment happens for the reverse reads files.
