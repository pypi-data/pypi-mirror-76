"""
Contains a Transfer class that encapsulates working with the Google Storage Transfer Service to
transfer files from AWS S3 to GCP buckets. If you want to run this on a GCP VM, then in the 
`command <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts#acting_as_a_service_account>`_
used to launch the VM you should specify an appropriate security account and the `cloud-platform scope`_
as the following example demonstrates::

  gcloud compute instances create myinstance --service-account="test-819@sigma-night-206802.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --scopes=cloud-platform --zone us-central1-a 

Google implements OAuth 2 scopes for requesting accessing to specific Google APIs, and in our case 
it's the cloud-platform scope that we need, which is associated with the Storage Transfer API, amongst others.
See the documentation in the :class:`Transfer` class below for more details.
Also, the Storage Transfer API documentation is available at 
https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/storagetransfer/v1/python/latest/
https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#auth-cloud-explicit-python

If running this in Google Cloud Composer, you must use specific versions of several Google libraries
so that the tasks running in the environment can properly use the credentials and scope that you 
delegated to the environment when creating it. This is a work-around, as the Composer environment is
buggy at present in this regard. You'll need a requirements.txt file with the following (thanks to
danxmoran for pointing out):

  google-api-core==1.5.0
  google-api-python-client==1.7.4
  google-auth==1.5.1
  google-auth-httplib2==0.0.3
  google-cloud-core==0.28.1

Then use the following commands to create and set up your Cloud Composer environment:

```
  gcloud beta composer environments create test-cc-env3 --python-version=3 --location=us-central1 --zone=us-central1-a --disk-size=20GB --service-account=fasdf-29@sigma-night-206802.iam.gserviceaccount.com

  gcloud composer environments update env3 --location us-central1 --update-pypi-packages-from-file requirements.txt
```

    Encapsulates the transfer of files from AWS S3 storage to GCP storage by using the Google Storage
    Transfer Service (STS). The ``create()`` method is used to create a transfer job (termed 
    `transferJob` in the STS API). A transferJob either runs once (a one-off job) or is scheduled 
    to run repeatedly, depending on how the job schedule is specified. 

    Any transfer event of a trasferJob is termed as a transferOperation in the STS API. There are 
    a few utility methods in this class that work with transferOperations.

    You'll need to have a `Google service account`_ set up with at least the two roles below:

      1) Project role with access level of Editor or greater.
      2) Storage role with access level of Storage Object Creator or greater.


    If running on a non-GCP VM, the service account credentials are fetched from the environment 
    via the variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS. This should be set to the JSON file provided to you
    by the GCP Console when you create a service account; see
    https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started for more details. 

    If instead you are running this on a GCP VM, then you should specify the service account and 
    OAuth 2 scope when launching the VM as described at the beginning; there is no need use the 
    service account file itself. 

    Note1: if this is the first time that you are using the Google STS on your GCP bucket, 
    it won't work just yet as you'll get an error that reads:

      **Failed to obtain the location of the destination Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket due to
      insufficient permissions.  Please verify that the necessary permissions have been granted.
      (Google::Apis::ClientError)**

    To resolve this, I recommend that you go into the GCP Console and run a manual transfer there,
    as this adds the missing permission that you need. I personaly don't know how to add it
    otherwise, or even know what it is that's being added, but there you go!  

    Note2: If you try to transfer a file that is mistyped or doesn't exist in the source bucket, then
    this will not set a failed status on the transferJob. If you really need to know whether a file
    was tranferred in the API, you need to query the transferOperation; see the method 
    :func:`get_transfers_from_job`.
