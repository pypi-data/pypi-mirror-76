        ### Mandatory arguments
        * file - The path to a file containing data that have been exported to a .csv from the software Picoscope. The file have to be in the following format:
        
        ```
        Time;Channel A
        (ms);(mV)
        
        -200,00015929;-0,21362960
        -200,00004729;-0,73854790

        ### Arguments
        * -h, --help - Showing a help message with all the available arguments.
        * -i lower upper - Set an interval in the x-axis (time). This can be used to isolate parts of a signal that is of interest.
        * -fff - Used to invoke running a FFT on the given signal.
        * -lp cutoff - Applying a low pass filter on the signal. Can be used to remove high frequency disturbances.
        * -hp cutoff - Applying a high pass filter on the singal. Can be used to remove low frequency disturbances.
        * -bs lower upper - Applying a band stop filter on the signal. Can be used to remove disturbances that is defined by a band in the frequency spectrum.
        * -o - Can be used to set an alternative output folder.
        * --version - Prints the current version of the package.
