Description: # ImageGoNord - RGB image to Nordtheme palette
        A tool that can convert your rgb images to nordtheme palette.
        
        This repository is a CLI utility, written in python, that can convert any sort of image into a [nordtheme](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) palette image.
        <br>We are planning to make also an API so it can be more user friendly.
        
        <!--

        - State its goals/what problem(s) it solves.
        - Note and briefly describe any key concepts (technical, philosophical, or both) important to the user’s understanding.
        - Link to any supplementary blog posts or project main pages.
        - Note its development status.

        ### Inspiration
        
        We are in love with Nordtheme, that is why we created this repository.
        
        [![Nord Color Palette Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/develop/assets/images/nord/repository-color-palettes.svg?sanitize=true)](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes)
        
        Our goal is to make a shortcut to convert anything into this theme, by starting from the images.
        <br>An example could be an awesome wallpaper converted into the Nordtheme palette.
        
        We checked the commnunity and we did not find anything similar or any project that can accomplish this task. So, here we are.
        
        ### Core Technical Concepts
        
        We are using the PIL because it is the most simple library and it is very useful when you need to manipolate some images.
        
        Our goal is also to make this project open source and maintainable by the community. We would love to.
        
        *We believe in the open source community.*
