        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
           pip install humilis-stream-gtw

        ::

        Development
        -----------
        
        Assuming you have
        `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
        installed:
        
        ::
        
           make develop
        
        Configure humilis:
        
        ::
        
           make configure
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        You can test the deployment with:
        
        ::
        
           make test
        
        If the tests break, you can make sure you are not leaving any
        infrastructure behind with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           make delete
