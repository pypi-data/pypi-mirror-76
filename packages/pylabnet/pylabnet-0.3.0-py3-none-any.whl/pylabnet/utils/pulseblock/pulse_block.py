class PulseBlock:
    """ Class for construction of pulse sequences.

    PulseBlock is essentially a container which has several "shelves" (channels),
    and each pulse is represented by a "box" (Pulse object) sitting on the shelf.
    Each "box" must have a name tag: "channel name - start time - duration".
    PulseBlock makes no additional assumptions about the contents of the boxes.

    Since the "boxes" do not necessarily cover the entire duration, there are
    some gaps. To specify what is happening during the gaps, one uses DfltPulse
    objects - "default pulses" (a single DfltPulse per channel).

    PulseBlock handles everything related to keeping the "boxes" time-ordered
    when new elements are added: it has methods for inserting additional "boxes"
    into arbitrary (empty) places on the "shelf" and for merging several smaller
    PulseBlocks into a large one.


    --------------- Structure ---------------

    The main attribute of PulseBlock object is p_dict - the pulse dictionary.
    This is where the entire pulse sequence is stored. In the dictionary:
        Key - the channel name;
        Value - time-ordered list of Pulse objects for this channel.

    After any operation, time axis origin is shifted for the entire PulseBlock
    such that the beginning of earliest Pulse is set to 0.

    PulseBlock assumes that each Pulse object has the following attributes:
        ch - (str) channel name;
        t0 - (numeric) pulse start time;
        dur - (numeric) duration of the pulse,

    dflt_dict attribute contains the default pulse objects:
        Key - (str) channel name
        Value - DfltPulse object

    In addition, PulseBlock has the following attributes:
        name (str) - name of the sequence
        dur (numeric) - total duration of the sequence
                        (t0+dur of the latest Pulse object)
