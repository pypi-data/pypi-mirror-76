""" Set of tools to stop continuously running script from a different process
via RPyC link.

Steps:
- the script class should have public method pause(),
  which will be called by client through RPyC link
- once the script is instantiated, assign it as the module to
  PauseService instance:
      pause_service_instance.assign_module(script_instance)
- instantiate PauseClient in a different process
- call of PauseClient.pause() will call pause() method of the script
