""" pylabnet measurement and service classes for Swabian Instruments TimeTagger
which implements qudi's SlowCounter interface.

This file contains pylabnet wrapper and service classes to allow qudi to
access Swabian Instruments TT through pylabnet network as SlowCounter.

Steps:
- instantiate TimeTagger
- instantiate pylabnet-SlowCtrWrap (pass ref to TimeTagger as tagger)
- instantiate pylabnet-SlowCtrService and assign module to the created wrapper
- start pylabnet-server for SlowCtrService
- in qudi, instantiate SlowCtrClient as one of the hardware modules
