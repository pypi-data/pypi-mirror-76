"""This file contains the pylabnet client which allows qudi to access
Swabian Instruments TT through pylabnet network as SlowCounter.

Steps:
- instantiate Time Tagger
- instantiate pylabnet-SlowCtrWrap (pass ref to Time Tagger as tagger)
- instantiate pylabnet-SlowCtrService and assign module to the created wrapper
- start pylabnet-server for SlowCtrService
- in qudi, instantiate SlowCtrClient as one of the hardware modules

Currently broken, as the link from pylabnet to Qudi has been severed
