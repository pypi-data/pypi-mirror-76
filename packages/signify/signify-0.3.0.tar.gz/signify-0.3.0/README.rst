Signify, a portmanteau of *signature* and *verify*, is a Python module that computes and validates signatures.
At this point it is mostly a library that verifies PE Authenticode-signed binaries.

This module is a forked from Google's ``verify_sigs`` module, updated to fit
modern Python standards and be compatible with Python 3. It is **not** a drop-in
replacement, as significant changes have occurred.

This module is compatible with Python 3.5+ and does not support Python 2.
