Release notes
=============
This page contains the most significant changes in Signify between each release.

v0.3.0 (2020-08-16)
-------------------
This release should be mostly backwards-compatible, but various features have been added that warranted a larger
version increase.

* Support for passing in a different trusted certificate store than the default in various verify functions
* Added option to ignore countersignature errors when validating
* Added support for SHA-384 and SHA-512
* Added ``Certificate.from_pems``, ``Certificate.__hash__``, ``Certificate.sha1_fingerprint``,
  ``Certificate.sha256_fingerprint``
* Added ``CertificateStore.find_certificate`` and ``CertificateStore.find_certificates``
* Added support for ``authroot.stl`` (``signify.authroot``), though we haven't figured out how it works exactly yet.
  Support can be used by adding a ctl to a trusted ``CertificateStore``.
* Updated authenticode certificate store by basing it on Microsoft's ``authroot.stl``
* Fixed bug in RFC3161 countersignatures that contain malformed RFC5652 structures
* Fixed bug in RFC3161 countersignatures that have a different digest function and hash function

v0.2.0 (2020-04-27)
-------------------
This release contains various backwards-incompatible changes.

* Fix error that SpcSpOpusInfo was considered required
* Fix error that CounterSignerInfo would require a specific content type
* Fix error that countersignatures could be present as entire RFC3161 responses
* Add option to process CRL checks and OCSP responses

v0.1.3 (2018-12-15)
