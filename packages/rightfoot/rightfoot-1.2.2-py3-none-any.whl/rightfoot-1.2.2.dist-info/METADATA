to their loans.

`API Documentation <https://docs.rightfoot.com>`_

This repository provides Python bindings for Rightfoot's API.

Installation
############
Install Rightfoot from PyPi with pip

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install rightfoot


Getting Started
###############
First create a client at the desired endpoint along with your credentials.

.. code-block:: python

    import rightfoot

    configuration = rightfoot.Configuration()
    # Defaults to sandbox, but can be explicitly set to sandbox/production.
    configuration.host="https://sandbox.api.rightfoot.com/v1"
    configuration.api_key['Authorization'] = os.env['RIGHTFOOT_API_KEY']
    configuration.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = 'Bearer'
    rightfoot_client = rightfoot.RightfootApi(rightfoot.ApiClient(configuration))


Then a request to create a beneficiary can be made.

.. code-block:: python

    import rightfoot
    from rightfoot.rest import ApiException

    mailing_address = rightfoot.models.MailingAddress(
        line1="123 Easy Street", city="Palo Alto", state="CA", zip_code="12345-0123")
    request = rightfoot.CreateBeneficiaryRequest(
        first_name="John", last_name="Doe", date_of_birth="1970-01-01",
        phone_number="+1 650 555 5555", mailing_address=mailing_address)

    try:
        response = rightfoot_client.create_beneficiary(request)
        print(response)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling RightfootApi->create_beneficiary: %s\n" % e)

Notes on API Client Source
##########################
Rightfoot uses `swagger-codegen <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen>`_
to create and maintain its SDKs whenever possible. Requests for modifications
are accepted but required departing from the Swagger/OpenAPI templates for SDKs,
which we try to avoid as much as possible in the interest of stability and
ability to leverage improvements and security patches from those base templates
as much as possible.
