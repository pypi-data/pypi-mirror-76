        Put stats about your stepmania library into a SQLite database. Will export all songs with data about their groups,
        difficulty levels, durations, bpms, etc. Particularly useful if you use the database with
        [datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/).
        
        ## How to install
        
            $ pip install stepmania-to-sqlite
        
        Add the `-U` flag to update. Change notes can be found in the ``CHANGELOG`` file, next to this README.
        
        ## Importing data
        
        Run the tool with the path to your database - if it doesn't exist yet, it will be created:
        
            $ stepmania-to-sqlite songs.db
        
        If your library is not located in a directory like ``~/.stepmania*``, you can pass the library path with the -l flag:
        
            $ stepmania-to-sqlite songs.db -l /path/to/library
            
        ## Limitations
        
        - Steps are not included, only pre-processed step counts per difficulty.
        - Currently, only .sm files are parsed, not the newer .ssc files.
