      - Nowadays thousands of RNA-seq data are available and could be used for metaanalysis. However to deal with data heterogeneity and the weaknesses of the RNAseq technology we need to filter data series for selecting the most homogeneous ones.
      - Read coverage bias from 5' to 3' end can be one important parameter to analyse. Indeed if reads primarily accumulate at the 3â€™ end of transcripts in poly(A)-selected samples, this might indicate low RNA quality in the starting material (Conesa et al. Genome Biology 2016). From mapping process, tools for quality control in mapping are used including Picard, RSeQC and Qualimap. Here, to check with the uniformity of read coverage,  we selected and counted specific kmers from house keeping genes (see also orientation section selection) and distinguished the kmer counting mean from  5', 3' and CDS regions for those genes. The result are presented for each sample with the cumulated mean of each region.  In absence of a biais, one expected a conserved proportion of the corresponding region among samples, conversely, if a bias is present in the data this proportion will be lost.
