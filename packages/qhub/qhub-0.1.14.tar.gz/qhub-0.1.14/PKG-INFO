Description: # QHub
        
        Is a tool for initializing and maintaining the state of QHub
        deployments on Digital Ocean, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud
        Platform.
        
        ## Installation:
        
        ```bash
        pip install qhub
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        QHub is entirely controlled from a configuration file. Example
        configuration files can be found in
        [tests/assets](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/tree/master/tests/assets). Documentation
        on creating a configuration file is detailed [here](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/blob/master/qhub/template/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.repo_directory%20%7D%7D/docs/configuration.md).
        
        Templates for each file are at the following paths:
          - AWS :: tests/assets/config_aws.yaml
          - DO  :: tests/assets/config_do.yaml
          - GCP :: tests/assets/config_gcp.yaml
        
        ## Initializing the Provider Template
        
        The exact naming of the configuration file is needed to trigger the CI
        actions when the configuration is changed.
        
        ```bash
        mkdir <repository-name>
        # mv <config-filename> <repository-name>/qhub-config.yaml
        qhub render -c <repository-name>/qhub-config.yaml -o <repository-name>/ --force
        ```
        
        After initialising the provider templates, follow the instructions in
        docs on deploying the infrastructure at
        `<repository-name>/docs/installation.md`. At this current moment some
        bootstrapping is required before github-actions can manage the
        infrastructure as code. All of these instructions are automated in
        `scripts/00-guided-install.sh`. Note that you will need to set the
        environment variables in `intallation.md` for this script to
        succeed. You will be prompted several times for use actions such as
        setting oauth provider and dns.
        
        ```bash
        scripts/00-guided-install.sh
        ```
        
        ## Terraform Module Dependencies
        
        This project depends on the terraform modules repository:
        https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-terraform-modules
        
        ## Architecture
        
        The architecture diagrams for each cloud provider is in `architecture` folder.
        To generate them, just run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        python <diagram_file>.py
        ```
