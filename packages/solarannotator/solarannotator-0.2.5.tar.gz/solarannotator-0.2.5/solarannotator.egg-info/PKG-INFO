        On the left hand side, you will see a preview that can be maniuplated with the controls below. 
        It allows for viewing different SUVI channels with different configurations, e.g. one color versus three color. 
        When you wish to annotate, simply draw on top of this window after selecting the 
        desired theme radio button.
