@NUTSHELL Brew
From 83bismuth38.
Extensible to any number of states by changing the 4 in `states: 4`.

The two transitions were formerly
> any, [live] ~ 3, --[1]; [1]
> live, [0] ~ 2, --[0]; [0]
...which mirrored the original ruletable. Doing it with inline
rulestrings, however, allows for ANY isotropic Brew to be
constructed from this same Nutshell!
