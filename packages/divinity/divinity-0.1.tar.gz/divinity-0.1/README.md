# Divinity
Divinity is a custom timeseries forecast library. This is currently
 in development and designed to automate and 
 generalise (as much as possible) the process of 
 generating any timeseries forecast. 
 
 Please see the [demo Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/dstarkey23/divinity/blob/master/Documentation/demo.ipynb) for example useage.

 This is an RnD project aiming to start simply and 
 build additional functionality as needed. Please see
 the issues and project page for a backlog of functionality
 to be added to the package.
