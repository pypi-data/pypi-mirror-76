# Vitis Data Compression Library

This set of notebooks introduces some of the higher-level functions of the
Xilinx [data compression library](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries/tree/b658aa5cd262d080048526ce931d4570cb931a36/data_compression)
which are part of the set of [Vitis Libraries](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries).
These examples are designed to showcase the core parts of the library in
particular:

 * Library structure and LZ4 compression (*Intro to Compression*)
 * Improving performance through overlapping communication and compute (*Overlapping Communication and Compute*)
 * DEFLATE compression (*ZLIB Compression*)

Bitstreams are provided for the following boards:

 * Xilinx U200
 * Xilinx U250
 * Amazon AWS F1

To install the example follow the instructions in the [repository's
README](../../../README.md).
