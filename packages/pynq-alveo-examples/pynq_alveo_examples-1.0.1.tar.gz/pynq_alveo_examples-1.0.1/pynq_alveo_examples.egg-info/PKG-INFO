Description: This project includes introductory examples for using 
        [PYNQ](http://www.pynq.io/) with Alveo. It requires `pynq` version `2.5.1` and 
        above to work.
        
        Refer to the 
        [README](https://github.com/Xilinx/Alveo-PYNQ/tree/master/overlays/README.md) 
        in the `overlays` folder for more information regarding the used overlays and 
        how they are created.
        
        Please notice that not all overlays might be available for all target devices. 
        Supported devices are listed in the overlays 
        [README](https://github.com/Xilinx/Alveo-PYNQ/tree/master/overlays/README.md). 
        There you may also find instructions on how to synthesize and use overlays for 
        a different device.
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        Install the `pynq-alveo-examples` package using `pip`:
           ```bash
           pip install pynq-alveo-examples
           ```
        
        After the package is installed, to get your own copy of all the notebooks 
        available run:
           ```bash
           pynq get-notebooks
           ```
        
        You can then try things out by doing:
           ```bash
           cd pynq-notebooks
           jupyter notebook
           ```
        
        There are a number of additional options for the `pynq get-notebooks` command,
        you can list them by typing 
           ```bash
           pynq get-notebooks --help
           ```
        
        You can also refer to the official 
        [PYNQ documentation](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/) for more information 
        regarding the *PYNQ Command Line Interface* and in particular the 
        `get-notebooks` command.
