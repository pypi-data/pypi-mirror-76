# Read The Docs

While guilded.py does have a ReadTheDocs page ([![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/guildedpy/badge/?version=latest)](https://guildedpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)), you'll be better off following the docs in [the Guilded API server](https://guilded.gg/guilded-api) for now.
