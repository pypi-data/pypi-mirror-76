"""
A formatter plugin to show the bond orientation statistics along the rings in an ice strucure.

Usage:
    genice 5 -f _ringstat

_ringstat plugin makes the statistics of bond orientations along each
HB ring and compare the distribution with that of an ideal (isolated
random) ring. The difference in the distribution is evaluated by
Kullback-Leibler divergence, d_{KL}.

A typical dKL is zero for hydrogen-disordered ices, while it is
larger than 1 for hydrogen-ordered ones like ices 2 and 9.

Ringstat analysis validates the ring-scale randomness. GenIce tool
also certifies the zero net dipole moment and Bernal-Fowler-Pauling
ice rule in terms of the validity in global and local structures.

Columns in the output:
  ring size
  code (decimal) indicating the orientations of the bonds along a cycle.
  code (binary)
  expectation (fractional) for an isolated random ring
  expectation (numerical)
  observation (fractional) in the given structure
  observation (numerical)

Finally, dKL between expectiations and observations is also shown.
