Installation

Usage
-----

Specifying how many times to rerun
##################################

By default, one rerun attempt is made. You can set the amount of times to attempt a rerun by passing the ``--dynamic-rerun-attempts`` flag when invoking pytest or including the ``dynamic_rerun_attempts`` INI key.

To pass the flag::

    python3 -m pytest --dynamic-rerun-attempts=3

To set the INI key add the following to your config file's ``[pytest]`` section::

    [pytest]
    dynamic_rerun_attempts = 123

Passing a non positive integer value will set the number of rerun attempts to the default.

Specifying what to rerun on
###########################

By default, all failed tests are rerun. You can change this behavior by either passing the ``--dynamic-rerun-triggers`` flag when invoking ``pytest`` or including the ``dynamic_rerun_triggers`` INI key. Note that regular expressions are allowed.

To pass the flag::

    python3 -m pytest --dynamic-rerun-triggers="a triggering trace"

To set the INI key add the following to your config file's ``[pytest]`` section::

    [pytest]
    dynamic_rerun_triggers = a triggering trace

Note that at this time only ``stdout``, ``stderr``, and exceptions are checked.

Specifying a rerun interval
###########################

You can specify an interval to rerun tests on by either passing the ``--dynamic-rerun-schedule`` flag to python when invoking ``pytest`` or including the ``dyanmic_rerun_schedule`` INI key.

Internally, this plugin uses `croniter`_ to schedule wait times. Because of this, we are able to schedule wait times with second level granularity. Visit the croniter repository ``README`` to find out more information on this.

To pass the flag::

    python3 -m pytest --dynamic-rerun-schedule="* * * * * *"

To set the INI key add the following to your config file's ``[pytest]`` section::

    [pytest]
    dynamic_rerun_schedule = * * * * * *

Note that any valid cron schedule is accepted. If this flag is not passed or set in the INI file, this plugin will not take effect. Passing an invalid value will force the interval to default to ``* * * * * *`` ( every second ).

Using markers to rerun tests
############################

We can achieve the above functionality through markers as well. This plugin defines the ``dynamicrerun`` mark, which can be used as follows::

    @pytest.mark.dynamicrerun(attempts=10, triggers="foo", schedule="* * * * * *")
    def test_print_foo():
        print("foo")

Note that first we check for arguments in markers, then command line switches, and only then do we check in INI files.

Developing against this plugin
------------------------------
This plugin exposes the following attributes on the ``item`` object:

* ``dynamic_rerun_run_times ( list )``: The list of times this item was run by the plugin. Note this includes the original non dynamically rerun run.
* ``dynamic_rerun_schedule(string)``: The schedule to rerun this item on. See the section ``Specifying a rerun interval`` above for more details.
* ``dynamic_rerun_sleep_times (list)``: A list of `timedelta objects`_ representing the time slept in between reruns for the item
* ``dynamic_rerun_triggers (list)``: The rerun triggers for this specific item. See the section ``Specifying what to rerun on`` above for more details.
* ``max_allowed_dynamic_rerun_attempts(int)``: The maximum amount of times we are allowed to rerun this item. See the section ``Specifying how many times to rerun`` above for more details.
* ``num_dynamic_reruns_kicked_off (int)``: The amount of reruns launched at the moment of inspection for this item.

This plugin exposes the following attributes on the ``session`` object:

* ``dynamic_rerun_items (list)``: The list of items that are set to be dynamically rerun on the next iteration
