        --------------
        
        **Codimension** is yet another free experimental Python IDE licensed
        under GPL v3.
        
        Codimension aims to provide an integrated system for:
        
        -  traditional text-based code editing, and
        -  diagram-based code analysis.
        
        At the moment a few graphics oriented features are implemented. One of
        the major (and the most visible) is a generation of a control flow
        diagram while the code is typed. The screenshot below shows the main
        area divided into two parts. The left one is a traditional text editor
        while the right one is a generated diagram. The diagram is updated when
        the IDE detects a pause in typing the code.

        The IDE implements many of the typical features to support the
        development process. The uniqueness of the IDE however is in the
        graphics representation of the code. Thus the main focus of the project
        is to implement more features for the graphics pane.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **Note:** python 3.5/3.6/3.7 is required
        
        The IDE is pip installable:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           pip install codimension
        
        The feature of building some diagrams e.g.Â a dependency diagram requires
        a graphviz package. The installation depends on a system. E.g. on Ubuntu
        you would need to do the following:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           sudo apt-get install graphviz
        
        To have plantUML diagram support java needs to be installed. The
        installation depends on a system. E.g. on Ubuntu you would need to do
        the following:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           sudo apt-get install default-jre
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        The IDE depends on a couple of the binary modules which are compiled at
        the time of the installation. So your system needs a g++ compiler
        installed as well as python interpreter header files. To install the
        required packages on Ubuntu you would need to do the following:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           sudo apt-get install g++
           sudo apt-get install python3-dev
           sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev
