Description: # Zunzun Framework
        
        Zunzun is a Python framework that uses other libraries to implement its features. Ones of them are:
        
        - [injector](https://pypi.org/project/injector/) It's used to Dependency Injection.
        - [click](https://pypi.org/project/click/) For creating commands line interface.
        - [blinker](https://pypi.org/project/blinker/) Provides a fast dispatching system.
        - [SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) The Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper.
        
        ## Create an application
        
        1. Clone the example application from https://github.com/aprezcuba24/zunzun_app
        2. Create .env file base on .env.example
            - Configure database configuration
        3. You can use vscode to open the application in a container.
        4. Star the application using this command.
        ```
        python manage.py core runserver
        ```
        5. Open the browser in this url `http://localhost:8001/`
        
        ## Controller
        We can create two types of controller, a function controller, or a class controller.
        
        ### Function controller
        
        ```python
        from main import router
        
        
        @router.post("/")
        def register():
            return "Register"
        ```
        
        ### Class controller
        To create a class controller we can use the following command
        
        ```
        python zunzun.py maker controller Role --route="/role"
        ```
        
        Where "Role" will be the name of the controller and "/role" the path to access the controller.
        
        The command will generate the file `app/controllers/role.py`
        
        ```python
        from zunzun import Response
        from main import router
        
        class RoleController:
            @router.get('/role')
            def index(self):
                return "RoleController Index"
        ```
        In the class controller or in the function controller we can inject dependencies.
        For example, if we have a service named "PaypalService" we can inject it, with the following code.
        ```python
        from main import router
        from app.services import PaypalService
        
        
        @router.post("/")
        def register(paypal: PaypalService):
            paypal.call_a_method()
            return "Register"
        ```
        In a controller class, we can inject dependencies in the constructor or in any function.
        ```python
        from zunzun import Response
        from main import router
        from app.services import PaypalService, SomeService
        
        class RoleController:
            def __init__(self, some_service: SomeService):
                self.some_service = some_service
        
            @router.get('/role')
            def index(self, paypal: PaypalService):
                return "RoleController Index"
        ```
        ## Commands
        Commands allow us to implement command line features. To do that we can use the following command.
        ```
        python manager.py maker command role
        ```
        Where "role" will be the name of the command. This command will create the following file `app/commands/role.py`.
        ```python
        import click
        from injector import singleton, inject
        from zunzun import Command
        
        
        @singleton
        class roleCommand(Command):
            @inject
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__("role")
                self.add_option("--some-option")
                self.add_argument("some-argument")
        
            def handle(self, some_option, some_argument):
                click.echo(
                    f"roleCommand [some_argument: {some_argument}] [some_option: {some_option}]"
                )
        ```
        To use the new command we can type the following in the console.
        ```
        python manager.py app role "An argument value" --some-option="An option value"
        ```
        ## Listener
        The listener allows us to implement the Event-Dispatcher pattern. To create a new listener with its signal we can use the following command.
        ```
        python manager.py maker listener Role Role
        ```
        Where the first word "Role" will be the listener name and the second will be the signal name.
        The command will generate the following files:
        
        - Signal file `app/signals/role.py`
        - Listener file `app/listeners/role.py`
        
        The signal file will have this code.
        ```python
        from zunzun import Signal
        from injector import singleton
        
        
        @singleton
        class RoleSignal(Signal):
            pass
        ```
        The listener file will have this code.
        ```python
        from injector import singleton
        
        
        @singleton
        class RoleListener:
            def __call__(self, sender, **kwargs):
                pass
        ```
        ## Services
        We can create classes to implement any logic that we need. For example to create a service to integrate Paypal we can use the following command.
        ```
        python manager.py maker service Paypal
        ```
        The command will create the file `app/services/paypal.py` with the following code.
        ```python
        from injector import singleton, inject
        
        
        @singleton
        class PaypalService:
            @inject
            def __init__(self):
                pass
        ```
        ## ORM
        Zunzun uses **SQLAlchemy** to implement the ORM features. The framework uses two type of classes.
        
        - The model represents a single row in the database.
        - The repository is a class to implement the queries to the database.
        
        To create the model and its repository we can use the following command.
        ```
        python manager.py orm model_create Role
        ```
        The model will be
        ```python
        from zunzun import orm
        from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer
        
        
        class Role(orm.BaseModel):
            __tablename__ = "Role"
            id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        ```
        The repository will be
        ```python
        from injector import singleton
        from zunzun import orm
        from app.model import Role
        
        
        @singleton
        class RoleRepository(orm.BaseRepository):
            def new(self, **kwargs):
                return Role(**kwargs)
        ```
        ## Dependency injection
        The framework uses this pattern to manage dependencies. To know how you can use see the documentation on [inject](https://pypi.org/project/injector/)
