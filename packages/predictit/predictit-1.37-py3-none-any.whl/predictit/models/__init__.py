""" Subpackage include models from libraries such as Tensorflow, Statsmodels, Sklearn and some own simple models.
Various models are included autoregressive model, ARIMA, LSTM, various regressions such as linear or ridge
and finally some neural units and conjugate gradient. You can use compare_models function to compare models on test data.
You can see results of all models in interactive plot.

All models are described in docstrings in it's modules.
