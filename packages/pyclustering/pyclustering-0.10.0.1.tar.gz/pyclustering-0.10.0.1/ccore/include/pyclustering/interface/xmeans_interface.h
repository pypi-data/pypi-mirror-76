@brief   Clustering algorithm X-Means returns allocated clusters.
@details Caller should destroy returned result in 'pyclustering_package'.

@param[in] p_sample: input data for clustering.
@param[in] p_centers: initial coordinates of centers of clusters.
@param[in] p_kmax: maximum number of clusters that can be allocated.
@param[in] p_tolerance: stop condition for local parameter improvement.
@param[in] p_criterion: cluster splitting criterion.
@param[in] p_repeat: how many times K-Means should be run to improve parameters (by default is `1`), 
            with larger 'repeat' values suggesting higher probability of finding global optimum.
@param[in] p_random_state: seed for random state (by default is `RANDOM_STATE_CURRENT_TIME`, current system time is used).

@return  Returns result of clustering - array of allocated clusters in the pyclustering package.
