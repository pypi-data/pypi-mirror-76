 *
 * @brief   Clustering algorithm MBSAS returns allocated clusters.
 * @details Caller should destroy returned result that is in 'pyclustering_package'.
 *
 * @param[in] p_sample: input data for clustering.
 * @param[in] p_amount: maximum allowable number of clusters that can be allocated during processing.
 * @param[in] p_threshold: threshold of dissimilarity (maximum distance) between points.
 * @param[in] p_metric: pointer to distance metric 'distance_metric' that is used for distance calculation between two points.
 *
 * @return  Returns result of clustering - array of allocated clusters in pyclustering package.
