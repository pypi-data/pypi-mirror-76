* Reverts commit that did db migration during configure\_db() and makes functional tests use in-memory database again. The issues we were seeing had to do with the timeout not being long enough when starting servers with disk-based registry databases and migrate taking too long when spinning up the registry server... this was shown in almost random failures of tests saying failure to start servers. Rather than increase the timeout from 3 seconds, I reverted the change that runs migrate on every startup and cut the total test duration down about 15 seconds

*     \* Changes Teller API to use REST with opaque ID sent in       API calls instead of a "parallax URI". This hides the       URI stuff behind the API layer in communication between       Parallax and Teller.     \* Adds unit tests for the only complete Teller API call so       far: GET images/<ID>, which returns a gzip'd string of       image data
* Fixing swapped port numbers, removing extraneous routes in Teller controller, adding required slash for do\_request calls
* \* Changes Teller API to use REST with opaque ID sent in   API calls instead of a "parallax URI".

* PUTing and POSTing using image key
* Quick fix...gives base Model an update() method to make it behave like a dict
* Make returned mapping have an 'image' key to help in XML serialization
* Ignore virtualenv directory in bzr
* This patch removes unique index on the 'key' column of image\_metadatum and replaces it with a compound UniqueConstraint on 'image\_id' and 'key'. The 'key' column remains indexed

* Fixing swift authurl
* Add RegistryAdapter, include ModelBase attributes
* Fixing Teller image tests
* Created teller-server.py in bin/
* Cleaning up Teller backend
* Rewrote ImageController to inherit from the work Rick Harris did in glance.common. Moved it into teller/api/images.py to make teller match parallax. Fixed tests. Renamed them to distinguish if any parallax tests ever get written
* Adding Image index call, nesting the Image show dict to facilitate XML serialization
* Moving parallax models out of common and into the parallax module
* Updated tests
* Reimplements server.py as a wsgi api inheriting from glance.common
* This patch:   \* pulls in a number of useful libraries from Nova under the common/ path (we can factor those out to a shared library in Bexar-release)   \* Defines the models in common.db.sqlalchemy.models.py (this should be factored out into the parallax package soon)   \* Adds the parallax api-server under /bin (if PyPI was used to pull python-daemon and python-lockfile, you may need to apply a patch I have against it)
