        ## Overview
        
        ## Setup
        
        Right now, the library is not hosted on **PyPi** so you will need to do a local
        install on your system if you plan to use it in other scrips you use.
        
        First, clone this repo to your local system. After you clone the repo, make sure
        to run the `setup.py` file, so you can install any dependencies you may need. To
        run the `setup.py` file, run the following command in your terminal.
        
        ```console
        pip install sigma.coding
        ```
        
        This will install all the dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file. Once done
        you can use the library wherever you want.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here is a simple example of using the `sigma` library to grab the index
        files for specific quarter.
        
        ```python
        ```
