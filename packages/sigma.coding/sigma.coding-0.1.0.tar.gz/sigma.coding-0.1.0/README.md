## Overview

## Setup

Right now, the library is not hosted on **PyPi** so you will need to do a local
install on your system if you plan to use it in other scrips you use.

First, clone this repo to your local system. After you clone the repo, make sure
to run the `setup.py` file, so you can install any dependencies you may need. To
run the `setup.py` file, run the following command in your terminal.

```console
pip install sigma.coding
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file. Once done
you can use the library wherever you want.

## Usage

Here is a simple example of using the `sigma` library to grab the index
files for specific quarter.

```python
```
