    * file: fetch from a file on the local file system. (Default if no scheme is provided.)
    * https: fetch using HTTP over TLS. HTTP basic authentication is not supported since it
        involves having the cleartext password in the URL.
    * gs: fetch from a Google Cloud Storage object. The URL should have the form
        "gs://bucket/path/to/object".
    * sm: fetch from a Google Secret Manager secret. The URL should have the form
        "sm://project/secret[#version]". If no version is provided the "latest" version is used.

    For "gs" and "sm" URLs, application default credentials are used.

    using appropriate exceptions for the backend specific to the scheme.
