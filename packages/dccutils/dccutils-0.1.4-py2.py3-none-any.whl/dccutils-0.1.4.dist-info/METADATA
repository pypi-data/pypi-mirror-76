DCC Utils
---------

This library offers a series of classes to abstract the most common features 
available in Digital Content Creation tools.

It currently supports Blender, Maya and Houdini.


How to use it
-------------

Install the library:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install dccutils


Then in your code (let's say you are working in Blender):

.. code-block:: python

    from dccutils import BlenderContext

    dcc_software_manager.blender = BlenderContext()
    print(dcc_software_manager.list_cameras())


Contributions
-------------

All contributions are welcome as long as they respect the `C4
contract <https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4>`__.

Code must follow the pep8 convention.
