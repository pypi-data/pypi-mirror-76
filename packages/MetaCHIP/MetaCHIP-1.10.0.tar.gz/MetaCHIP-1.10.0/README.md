#### Third-party software
MetaCHIP makes use of the following 3rd party dependencies and assumes they are on your system path. 
Otherwise, you can provide full path to their executables in lib/site-packages/MetaCHIP/MetaCHIP_config.py.

[Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal), 
[HMMER 3](http://hmmer.org),
[MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/),
[BLAST+](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download),
[FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/) and 
[Ranger-DTL 2.0](https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/software/RANGER-DTL/) (part of MetaCHIP, **NO NEED to install**).


How to install:
---

1. MetaCHIP can be installed via `pip3`:

        # First-time installation
        pip3 install MetaCHIP
        
        # for upgrade
        pip3 install --upgrade MetaCHIP
        
1. You can either add MetaCHIP's 3rd party dependencies to your system path or specify full path to their executables in MetaCHIP_config.py which can be found in Python's folder `lib/site-packages/MetaCHIP`.


How to run:
---

1. The input files for MetaCHIP include a folder that holds the sequence file [[example](https://github.com/songweizhi/MetaCHIP/blob/master/input_file_examples/human_gut_bins)] 
of all query genomes, as well as a text file [[example](https://github.com/songweizhi/MetaCHIP/blob/master/input_file_examples/human_gut_bins_GTDB.tsv)] 
which holds taxonomic classification of all input genomes. Please make sure **the length of sequence ID** for sequences of all input genomes are <font color="red"> **NO LONGER THAN 22 letters**</font>.

1. [**GTDB-Tk**](https://github.com/Ecogenomics/GTDBTk) is recommended for taxonomic classification of input genomes. 
GTDB-Tk with produce two files ([prefix].bac120.summary.tsv and [prefix].ar122.summary.tsv) containing the classification results 
if you have both bacterial and archaeal genomes included in your queries. You need to combine the two files into one and feed it as an input for MetaCHIP.

1. Options for argument '-r' for PI and BP modules can be any combinations of d (domain), p (phylum), c (class), o (order), f (family) and g (genus).

1. The all-against-all blastn comparison is the most time-consuming step. 
   You can speed up this step with job scripts if you are running MetaCHIP with HPC. 
   An example of the job script header [[example](https://github.com/songweizhi/MetaCHIP/blob/master/input_file_examples/blastn_job_script_header_demo.sh)] is needed in this case.
   The "MetaCHIP BP" module must be run **AFTER** all submitted jobs are finished.

1. Output format for BLASTN in the PI and BP steps: 
        
        -outfmt "6 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore qlen slen"

1. Some examples: 

    * show help information

            MetaCHIP -h
            MetaCHIP PI -h
            MetaCHIP BP -h
                
    * Detect HGT at single level (e.g. class) with 6 CPU cores
    
            MetaCHIP PI -p NorthSea -r c -t 6 -i bin_folder -x fasta -taxon NorthSea_GTDB_bac120_ar122_combined.tsv
            MetaCHIP BP -p NorthSea -r c -t 6

    * Detect HGT at multiple levels (e.g. phylum, class and order) with 12 CPU cores

            MetaCHIP PI -p NorthSea -r pco -t 12 -i bin_folder -x fasta -taxon NorthSea_GTDB_bac120_ar122_combined.tsv
            MetaCHIP BP -p NorthSea -r pco -t 12

    * Run MetaCHIP with qsub to speed up all-against-all blastn comparison. 
      Here is an example of the job script header file ([blastn_js_header.sh](https://github.com/songweizhi/MetaCHIP/blob/master/input_file_examples/blastn_js_header.sh)).
      **The BP module can only be run after all submitted jobs were finished!!!**
    
            MetaCHIP PI -p NorthSea -r pcofg -t 9 -i bin_folder -x fasta -taxon NorthSea_GTDB_bac120_ar122_combined.tsv -blastn_js_header blastn_js_header.sh -qsub
            MetaCHIP BP -p NorthSea -r pcofg -t 9

    * Detect HGT with customized grouping file.
      Here is an example of the customized grouping file ([customized_grouping.txt](https://github.com/songweizhi/MetaCHIP/blob/master/input_file_examples/customized_grouping.txt)).
      NOTE: bin file extension (e.g. fasta or fa) should **NOT** be included in the grouping file.
        
            MetaCHIP PI -p NorthSea -g customized_grouping.txt -t 6 -i NS_37bins -x fasta
            MetaCHIP BP -p NorthSea -g customized_grouping.txt -t 6


Output files:
---

1. A Tab delimited text file containing all identified HGTs. Filename format: `[prefix]_[taxon_ranks]_detected_HGTs.txt`

    |Column|Description|
    |---|---|
    |Gene_1|The 1st gene involved in a HGT event|
    |Gene_2|The 2nd gene involved in a HGT event|
    |Identity|Identity between Gene_1 and Gene_2|
    |Occurence(taxon_ranks)|Only for multiple-level detections. If you performed HGT detection at phylum, class and order levels, a number of "011" means current HGT was identified at class and order levels, but not phylum level.|
    |End_match|End match or not (see examples below)|
    |Full_length_match|Full length match or not (see examples below)|
    |Direction|The direction of gene flow. Number in parenthesis refers to the percentage of this direction being observed if this HGT was detected at multiple ranks and different directions were provided by Ranger-DTL.|   


1. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of identified donor and recipient genes.


1. Flanking regions of identified HGTs. Genes encoded on the forward strand are displayed in light blue, and genes coded on the reverse strand are displayed in light green. The name of genes predicted to be HGT are highlighted in blue, large font with pairwise identity given in parentheses. Contig names are provided at the left bottom of the sequence tracks and numbers following the contig name refer to the distances between the gene subject to HGT and either the left or right end of the contig. Red bars show similarities of the matched regions between the contigs based on BLASTN results.

1. Gene flow between groups. Bands connect donors and recipients, with the width of the band correlating to the number of HGTs and **the colour corresponding to the donors**.
