    Attribute names have been generated by converting ecobee property
    names from camelCase to snake_case.

    A getter property has been generated for each attribute.
    A setter property has been generated for each attribute whose value
    of READONLY is "no".

    An __init__ argument without a default value has been generated if
    the value of REQUIRED is "yes".
    An __init__ argument with a default value of None has been generated
    if the value of REQUIRED is "no".
