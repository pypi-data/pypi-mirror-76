=======================================
NOTE for FFMPEG_BIN/ directory on macOS
=======================================

This folder may contain the binaries files of ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay
statically compiled for macOS with Intel 64 bit, or symbolic links to 
binaries installed in the system or round in your user space.
Remember, if you want to use the static binaries of FFmpeg on this folder,
you need to create a directory named 'bin' and then copy the files into it

The statically compiled distributable binaries for macOS with Intel 64bit 
can be downloaded at:
    
    http://www.evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/

For legal reasons (for example: including FAAC for AAC support) it is illegal
to distribute the FFmpeg binary compiled in some countries of the world, for example,
with the FAAC codec for AAC support. The distributable binary of FFmpeg does not
include faac support, which, however, can be obtained from compiling the source code.
If you need the faac codec (or other codecs with special restrictions) in FFmpeg, you
should compile yourself from the source with the faac codec support.
