============================================
NOTE for FFMPEG_BIN/bin directory on MS Windows
============================================

This folder may contain the binaries files of ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe and ffplay.exe
statically compiled for Windows 64 bit, or symbolic links to binaries installed 
round the system. Remember, if you want to use the static binaries of FFmpeg on this folder,
you need to create a directory named 'bin' and then copy the files into it.

The statically compiled distributable binaries for MS Windows can be downloaded at:
    
    https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

Important NOTE:
---------------
on Windows 7 64-bit I have encountered some problems with the latest 
versions of FFmpeg. After some research and field tests I can confirm that 
version 3.1.5 of FFmpeg works well on Videomass.
All Old versions of FFmpeg for Windows can be found here:

For legal reasons (for example: including FAAC for AAC support) it is illegal to distribute
the FFmpeg binary compiled in some countries of the world, for example, with the FAAC codec
for AAC support. The distributable binary of FFmpeg does not include faac support, which,
however, can be obtained from compiling the source code. If you need the faac codec (or other
codecs with special restrictions) in FFmpeg, you should compile yourself from the source with
the faac codec support.
