=======================
NOTE FOR share-videomass folder configuration:
=======================

Update: November 30 2019
-----------------------

When you run the program for the first time, the contents of this folder will 
be copied to the user's Videomass configuration directory, according to the 
conventions of each operating system:

        On *nix OS's:   '~/.config/videomass'
        On MacOs:       '~/Library/Application Support/videomass'
        On Windows:     'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\videomass'
        
videomass.conf and videomassWin32.conf (for MS Windows) are the main 
Videomass configuration files and are also used for storing user preferences.

Furthermore, Videomass configuration directory is also used to store log files
during processes (e.g. during conversions, video downloads, etc.) and to load 
presets files on /presets folder.

Files with ".prst" format are simple text files with a JSON data structure. 
Now Videomass uses JSON data for its presets, this allowed some advantages 
in the presets management and some savings in system resources.
