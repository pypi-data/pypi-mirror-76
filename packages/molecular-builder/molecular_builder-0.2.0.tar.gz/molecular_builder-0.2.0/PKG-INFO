        # Molecular builder 
        
        This builder relies heavily on the atomic simulation environment (ase). I particular we use ase to generate crystals from space group descriptions. 
        
        This molecular builder is made with LAMMPS in mind. Usually, saving to input files for other simulators will work just fine, but anywhere a choice has to be made, convenience when preparing systems for LAMMPS will be prioritized. 
        
        ## Description
        This package facilitates building molecular systems. It has functions for creating bulk crystals and for fetching periodic boxes of non-crystalline systems from the internet. After generating bulk crystals, the user may carve out specific geometries, and combine several elements to create a system. 
        
        We also support adding water using packmol. This requires having packmol installed. 
        
        ## Installation 
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/henriasv/molecular-builder 
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Simple use case for creating a bulk alpha-quartz crystal. 
        ```python 
        from molecular_builder import create_bulk_crystal
        atoms = create_bulk_crystal("alpha_quartz", [50,100,200])
        write(atoms, "alpha_quartz.data)
        ```
        
        Please refer to the [documentation](https://henriasv.github.io/molecular-builder) for more usage examples.
