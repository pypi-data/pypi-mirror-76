IBAN number, the creditor, the amount and then the debtor is defined. Finally the QR invoice is generated and saved.

.. code-block:: python

    from qr_payment_slip.bill import QRPaymentSlip, Address

    payment_slip = QRPaymentSlip()

    # Set IBAN number (mandatory)
    payment_slip.account = "CH98 8914 4356 9664 7581 5"

    # Set address of creditor (mandatory)
    payment_slip.creditor = Address(name="Hans Muster", address_line_1="Musterstrasse", address_line_2="1",
                                    pcode=1000, town="Musterhausen")

    # Set amount (optional)
    payment_slip.amount = 100

    # Set address of debtor (optional)
    payment_slip.debtor = Address(name="Marie de Brisay", address_line_1="Dreib√ºndenstrasse 34", pcode=7260,
                                  town="Davos Dorf")

    # Generate and save qr payment slip
    payment_slip.save_as("my_bill.svg")
