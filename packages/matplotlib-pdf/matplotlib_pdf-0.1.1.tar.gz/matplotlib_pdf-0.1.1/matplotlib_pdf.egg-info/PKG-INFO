Description: # matplotlib_pdf
        `matplotlib_pdf` can maintain a PDF-file with Matplotlib figures as pages.  
        The container is initialized with a Path to a destination for putting the PDF-file with the figures.  
        `container.add_figure_page()` is called to add current figure to PDF.
        
        ## Example
        ```python
        # Make a container
        container = PDFFigureContainer(Path(output_dir, "container.pdf"))
        
        #
        # Make a figure
        #
        
        # Add figure to pdf
        container.add_figure_page()
        ```
        
        ## Additional Control
        Additional options and uses are:
        * The container can buffer many pages by calling `container.add_figure_page(commit=False)`, and them comiting them all to 
        the file using `container.update_file()` (to avoid constantly updating the file). 
        * You can specify figure with `add_figure_page(figure=fig)`. 
        
        #### Experimental
        * By running `container.set_timestamp()` before adding pages to a container, the container will add a time-stamp to 
        each page, allowing reader to see what each page has last been updated 
        (check documentation of method for options to `set_timestamp()`).
        * By running `container.set_enumeration()` before adding pages to a container, the container will add an enumeration to
        the pages (ex. `2 / 3`) (check documentation of method for options to `set_enumeration()`).
        
        ## Test-script
        Running the `__main__.py`-script will make three figures and pass them all to a PDF-file. It then overwrites the second
        page with a different figure. The end result is something like:
