        This package contains a python client for the OneFootball Network API. It allows OneFootballâ€™s content partners to publish articles onto the OneFootball platform. It also allows partners to update and delete articles that they have already published to the OneFootball platform.
        
        The API can be used by partners to set up their own services such that content published on their sites is automatically sent to OneFootball and natively integrated onto the OneFootball platform for OneFootball users.
        
        Please note that the OneFootball Network is a closed, invite-only platform and only authorized content partners are able to use the OneFootball Network API.
