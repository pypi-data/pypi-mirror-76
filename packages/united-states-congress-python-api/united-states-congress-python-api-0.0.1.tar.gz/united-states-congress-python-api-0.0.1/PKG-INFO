        ## Overview
        
        This is a python API client library that is used to collect data from the
        United States Congress and a few other departments inside the US Government.
        This library will make filtering the requests easier, and give you a nice easy
        to use tool to grab vital civic data to be used in a wide range of analysis.
        
        ## Setup
        
        To **install** the library, run the following command from the terminal.
        
        ```console
        pip install united-states-congress-python-api
        ```
        
        To **upgrade** the library, run the following command from the terminal.
        
        ```console
        pip install --upgrade united-states-congress-python-api
        ```
        
        This will install all the dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file. Once done
        you can use the library wherever you want.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here is a simple example of using the `congress` library to pull the bulk data
        sources and grabbing a speicifc year of bulk data for the Privacy Act Issuances.
        
        ```python
        from pprint import pprint
        from congress.client import Congress
        
        # Initialize the Congress Client.
        congress_client = Congress()
        
        # Grab the data sources.
        data_sources = congress_client.data_sources()
        pprint(data_sources)
        
        # Grab the different resources from the Privacy Act Issuance.
        pia_2017 = congress_client.privacy_act_issuances(file='2017')
        pprint(pia_2017)
        ```
