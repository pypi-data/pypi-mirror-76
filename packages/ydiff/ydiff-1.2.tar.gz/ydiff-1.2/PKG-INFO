        Term based tool to view *colored*, *incremental* diff in a version controlled
        workspace (supports Git, Mercurial, Perforce and Svn so far) or from stdin,
        with *side by side* (similar to ``diff -y``) and *auto pager* support. Requires
        python (>= 2.5.0) and ``less``.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Type ``ydiff -h`` to show usage::
        
            $ ydiff -h
            Usage: ydiff [options] [file|dir ...]
        
            View colored, incremental diff in a workspace or from stdin, with side by side
            and auto pager support
        
            Options:
              --version            show program's version number and exit
              -h, --help           show this help message and exit
              -s, --side-by-side   enable side-by-side mode
              -w N, --width=N      set text width for side-by-side mode, 0 for auto
                                   detection, default is 80
              -l, --log            show log with changes from revision control
              -c M, --color=M      colorize mode 'auto' (default), 'always', or 'never'
              -t N, --tab-width=N  convert tab characters to this many spaces (default: 8)
              --wrap               wrap long lines in side-by-side view
              -p M, --pager=M      pager application, suggested values are 'less' or 'cat'
              -o M, --pager-options=M
                                   options to supply to pager application
        
              Note:
                Option parser will stop on first unknown option and pass them down to
                underneath revision control. Environment variable YDIFF_OPTIONS may be
                used to specify default options that will be placed at the beginning
                of the argument list.
        
        Read diff from local modification in a *Git/Mercurial/Perforce/Svn* workspace
        (output from e.g. ``git diff``, ``svn diff``):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            cd proj-workspace
            ydiff                         # view colored incremental diff
            ydiff -s                      # view side by side, use default text width 80
            ydiff -s -w 90                # use text width 90 other than default 80
            ydiff -s -w 0                 # auto set text width based on terminal size
            ydiff -s -w 0 --wrap          # same as before, but also wrap long lines
            ydiff -s file1 dir2           # view modification of given files/dirs only
            ydiff -s -w90 --wrap -- -U10  # pass '-U10' to underneath revision diff tool
            ydiff -s -w90 --wrap -U10     # '--' is optional as it's unknown to ydiff
            ydiff -s --cached             # show git staged diff (git diff --cached)
            ydiff -s -r1234               # show svn diff to revision 1234
        
        Read log with changes in a *Git/Mercurial/Svn* workspace (output from e.g.
        ``git log -p``, ``svn log --diff``), note *--diff* option is new in svn 1.7.0:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            cd proj-workspace
            ydiff -l                    # read log along with changes
            ydiff -ls                   # equivalent to ydiff -l -s, view side by side
            ydiff -ls -w90 --wrap       # set text width 90 and enable wrapping as well
            ydiff -ls file1 dir2        # see log with changes of given files/dirs only
        
        Utilize a specific pager application:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            ydiff                           # default pager - less
            LESS_OPTS='-FRSX --shift 1'
            ydiff -p less -o "${LESS_OPTS}" # emulate default pager
            ydiff -p /usr/bin/less          # custom pager
            ydiff -p cat                    # non-paging ANSI processor for colorizing
        
        Pipe in a diff:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git log -p -2 | ydiff       # view git log with changes of last 2 commits
            git show 15bfa | ydiff -s   # view a given git commit, side by side
            svn diff -r1234 | ydiff -s  # view svn diff comparing to given revision
            diff -u file1 file2 | ydiff # view diff between two files (note the '-u')
            diff -ur dir1 dir2 | ydiff  # view diff between two dirs
        
            # View diff in a GitHub pull request, side by side
            curl https://github.com/ymattw/ydiff/pull/11.diff | ydiff -s
        
            # View a patch file in unified or context format, the latter depends on
            # command `filterdiff` from package `patchutils` which is available in
            # major Linux distros and MacPorts.
            #
            ydiff -s < foo.patch
        
        Redirect output to another patch file is safe:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            svn diff -r PREV | ydiff -s > my.patch
        
        Environment variable
        --------------------
        
        Environment variable ``YDIFF_OPTIONS`` may be used to specify default options
        that will be placed at the beginning of the argument list, for example:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            export YDIFF_OPTIONS='-s -w0 --wrap'
            ydiff foo                   # equivalent to "ydiff -s -w0 --wrap foo"
        
        Note the default pager ``less`` takes options from the environment variable
        ``LESS``.
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        If you feel more comfortable with a command such as ``git ydiff`` to trigger
        the ydiff command, you may symlink the executable to one named ``git-ydiff``
        as follows:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            ydiff_dir=$(dirname $(which ydiff))
            ln -s "${ydiff_dir}/ydiff" "${ydiff_dir}/git-ydiff"
        
        Known issues
        ------------
        
        Ydiff has following known issues:
        
        - Does not recognize `normal` diff, and depends on ``filterdiff`` (patchutils)
          to read `context` diff
        - Side by side mode has alignment problem for wide chars
        - Terminal might be in a mess on exception (type ``reset`` can fix it)
        
        Pull requests are very welcome, please make sure your changes can pass unit
        tests and regression tests by run ``make test`` (required tool *coverage* can
        be installed with ``pip install coverage``).  Also watch out `travis build`_
        after push, make sure it passes as well.

        --------
        
        I have another tool `coderev`_ which generates side-by-side diff pages for code
        review from two given files or directories, I found it's not easy to extend to
        support git so invented `ydiff`.  Idea of ansi color markup is also from
        project `colordiff`_.
