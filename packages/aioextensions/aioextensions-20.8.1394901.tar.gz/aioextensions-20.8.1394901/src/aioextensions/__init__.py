# Rationale

Modern services deal with a bunch of different tasks to perform:

![Latency comparison](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamadorueda/aioextensions/latest/docs/static/latency.png)

The important thing to note is that tasks can be categorized in two groups:

## CPU bound tasks

Those that happen inside the CPU, with very low latency and exploit the full
potential of the hardware in the computer.

![Resources of an CPU bound task](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamadorueda/aioextensions/latest/docs/static/resources_cpu_task.png)

Examples of these tasks include:

| Task                 | Latency in seconds |
|----------------------|-------------------:|
| CPU computation      |        0.000000001 |
| Memory access        |          0.0000001 |
| CPU Processing (1KB) |           0.000003 |
| Memory read (1MB)    |            0.00025 |

## IO bound tasks

Those that happen over a wire that transports data, with very high latencies
and do not exploit the full potential of the hardware because the only thing to
do is waiting until the data gets to the other end and comes back (round-trip).

![Resources of an IO bound task](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamadorueda/aioextensions/latest/docs/static/resources_io_task.png)

Examples of these tasks include:

| Task                 | Latency in seconds |
|----------------------|-------------------:|
| Disk access          |            0.00015 |
| HTTP to localhost    |             0.0005 |
| Disk read (1MB)      |               0.02 |
| HTTP to internet     |               0.15 |

# Speed and costs matter

At the end of the day, we want to minimize the amount of cost per user served
by the program, server, or service while maximizing the user perception of
speed.

In order to achieve this we need a model that allows us to exploit all CPU
cores and installed hardware in the machine, while maintaining the ability to
query large amounts of high-latency external services over the network:
databases, caches, storage, distributed queues, or input from multiple users.

# Concurrency model

Python's Async IO has a concurrency model based on an **event loop**, which
is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing what's needed.

This event-loop executes in the main thread of the Python interpreter and
therefore it's limited by the [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil), so it's
alone unable to exploit all hardware installed in the host.

However:

- CPU intensive work can be sent to a pool of processes, far from the
    event-loop and thus being able to bypass the
    [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil), exploiting many CPU cores in
    the machine, and leaving the event-loop schedule and coordinate incoming
    requests.
- IO intensive work can be sent to a pool of threads, far from the event-loop
    and thus being able to wait for high-latency operations without
    interrupting the event-loop work.

There is an important difference:

-  Work done by a pool of processes is executed in parallel: all CPU cores are
    being used.
-  Work done by a pool of threads is done concurrently: tasks execution is
    overlapping, but not necessarily parallel: only 1 task can use the CPU
    while the remaining ones are waiting the
    [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil).

## Solving CPU bound tasks efficiently

The optimal way to perform CPU bound tasks is to send them to separate
processses in order to bypass the [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil).

Usage:

    >>> from aioextensions import collect, in_process, run

    >>> def cpu_bound_task(id: str):
            print('doing:', id)
            # Imagine here something that uses a lot the CPU
            # For example: this complex mathematical operation
            for _ in range(10): 3**20000000
            print('returning:', id)
            return id

    >>> async def main():
            results = await collect([
                # in_process sends the task to a pool of processes
                in_process(cpu_bound_task, id)
                # Let's solve 5 of those tasks in parallel!
                for id in range(5)
            ])
            print('results:', results)

    >>> run(main())
    # I have 4 CPU cores in my machine
    doing: 0
    doing: 1
    doing: 2
    doing: 3
    returning: 1
    doing: 4
    returning: 2
    returning: 3
    returning: 0
    returning: 4
    results: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

As is expected, all CPU cores were used and we were hardware-efficient!

## Solving IO bound tasks efficiently

The optimal way to perform IO bound tasks is to send them to separate
threads. This does not bypass the [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil).
However, threads will be in idle state most of the time, waiting high-latency
operations to complete.

Usage:

    >>> from aioextensions import collect, in_thread, run
    >>> from time import sleep, time

    >>> def io_bound_task(id: str):
            print('time:', time(), 'doing:', id)
            # Imagine here something with high latency
            # For example: a call to the database, or this sleep
            sleep(1)
            print('time:', time(), 'returning:', id)
            return id

    >>> async def main():
            results = await collect([
                # in_thread sends the task to a pool of threads
                in_thread(io_bound_task, id)
                # Let's solve 5 of those tasks in parallel!
                for id in range(5)
            ])
            print('time:', time(), 'results:', results)

    >>> run(main)
    time: 1597623831 doing: 0
    time: 1597623831 doing: 1
    time: 1597623831 doing: 2
    time: 1597623831 doing: 3
    time: 1597623831 doing: 4
    time: 1597623832 returning: 0
    time: 1597623832 returning: 4
    time: 1597623832 returning: 3
    time: 1597623832 returning: 2
    time: 1597623832 returning: 1
    time: 1597623832 results: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

As is expected, all tasks were executed concurrently. This means that
instead of waiting five seconds for five tasks (in serial) we just waited one
second for all of them.

    The algorithm makes sure that at any point in time every worker is busy.
    Also, at any point in time there will be at most _number of `workers`_

    The `worker_greediness` parameter controlls how much each worker can
    process before waiting for you to retrieve results. This is important when
    the input stream is big as it allows you to control memory usage.

    .. tip::
        This is similar to asyncio.as_completed. However this returns results
        in order and allows you to control how much resources are consumed
        throughout the execution, for instance:

        - How many open files will be opened at the same time
        - How many HTTP requests will be performed to a service (rate limit)
        - How many sockets will be opened concurrently
        - Etc

        This is useful for finite resources, for instance: the number
        of sockets provided by the operative system is limited; going beyond it
        would make the kernel to kill the program abruptly.

        workers: The number of independent workers that will be processing
            the input stream.
        worker_greediness: How much tasks can a worker process before waiting
            for you to retrieve its results. 0 means unlimited.

    Yields:
        A future with the result of the next ready task. Futures are yielded in
        the same order of the input stream (opposite to asyncio.as_completed)

    .. tip::
        This approach may be many times faster than batching because

        the next task as soon as they are free (if greediness allows them).
