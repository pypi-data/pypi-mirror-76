        paramsurvey is a set of tools for creating and executing parameter surveys.
        
        paramsurvey has a pluggable parallel backend. The supported backends at present
        are python's multiprocessing module, and computing cluster software `ray`. An `mpi` backend is planned.
        
        ## Example
        
        ```
        import time
        import paramsurvey
        
        
        def sleep_worker(pset, system_kwargs, user_kwargs, raw_stats):
            time.sleep(pset['duration'])
            return {'slept': pset['duration']}
        
        
        paramsurvey.init(backend='multiprocessing')  # or 'ray', if you installed it
        
        psets = [{'duration': 0.3}] * 5
        
        results = paramsurvey.map(sleep_worker, psets, verbose=2)
        
        for r in results:
            print(r.duration, r.slept)
        ```
        
        prints, in addition to some debugging output, a result from each of the 5 sleep_worker calls.
        
        Here are a few more examples:
        
        * [The above example, with a few notes](scripts/paramsurvey-readme-example.py)
        * [An example of a multi-stage computation](scripts/paramsurvey-multistage-example.py), running several `map()` functions in a row
        * [An example of greedy optimization](scripts/paramsurvey-greedy-example.py), selecting the best alternative from each `map()` result
        
        ## Philosophy
        
        A parameter survey runs begins by initializing the software,
        specifying a backend ('multiprocessing' or 'ray').
        
        The user supplies a worker function, which takes a dict of parameters
        (pset) and returns a dict of results.
        
        The user also supplies a list of parameter sets, perhaps constructed
        using the helper function `paramsurvey.params.product()`.
        
        Calling `pararamsurvey.map()` executes the worker function once for
        each pset. It returns a `MapResults` object, containing the results,
        performance statistics, and information about any failures.
        
        You can call `paramsurvey.map()` more than once.
        
        ## Worker function limitations
        
        The worker function runs in a different address space and possibly on a different server.
        It shouldn't access any global variables.
        
        For hard-to-explain Python issues, be sure to define the worker
        function before calling `paramsurvey.init()`. The worker function should
        not be nested inside another function. On Windows, the main program file
        should have a [`if __name == '__main__'` guard similar to the examples
        at the top of the Python multprocessing documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
        
        ## The MapResults object
        
        The MapResults object has several properties:
        
        * results is a list of dictionaries; 'return' is the return value of the worker function, and 'pset' is the pset.
        * failed is a list of failed psets, plus an extra '_exception' key if an exception was raised in the worker
        * progress is a MapProgress object with properties containing the details of pset execution: total, started, finished, failures, exceptions
        * stats is a PerfStats object containing performance statistics
