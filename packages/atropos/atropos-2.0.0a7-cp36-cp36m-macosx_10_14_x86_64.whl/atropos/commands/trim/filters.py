"""
Classes for writing and filtering of processed reads.

A Filter is a callable that has the read as its only argument. If it is called,
it returns True if the read should be filtered (discarded), and False if not.

To be used, a filter needs to be wrapped in one of the Wrapper classes. To determine
what happens to a read, a list of Wrappers with different filters is created and
each Wrapper is called in turn until one returns True. The main program will
determine whether and where to write the read(s) based on whether it was rejected
by a filter, and which one.
