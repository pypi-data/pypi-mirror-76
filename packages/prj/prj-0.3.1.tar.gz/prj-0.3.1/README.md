# prj-0.3.1
Set up path dependencies of a python project from any submodule, or via interactive shell/IDLE.
Currently only works on Windows platform + python>=3.4.

Suppose you have a project called MYPROJECT, with the file structure

```
MYPROJECT/
  myproject/
    test/
      test_foo.py
    __init__.py
    foo.py
  readme.txt
  
MY_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY/
  a_package/
    __init__.py
```

Normally if we'd like to run the test\_foo.py (which imports myproject.foo),
we'd open the cmd in MYPROJECT folder and type in `python -m myproject.test.test_foo"`

But suppose we are actively editing the test_foo.py in a python IDLE and would like
to run it via the IDLE. That could be easily achieved if we had say _pydev_ for the IDLE, 
in which we have set MYPROJECT as the source folder.

Not so easy for those using the python standard IDLE, though. We'd have to add line

`sys.path.insert(0,__file__+'/../../..')`

and do so for every module we'd like to run (carefully counting the number of double dots). 
But what if we move the file? Change it again.

With __prj__, we can create a file called _prj.yaml_ in MYPROJECT folder (`MYPROJECT/prj.yaml`), 
in which we declare:

```
srcDirs:
 - $PRJPATH
```
  
and to every module we want to run interactively (test_foo.py), we add these lines at the top:

 ```
 import prj
 P = prj.qs(__file__)
 ```
 
which returns Project object, and inserts full path to MYPROJECT folder to sys.path (index 0).

`prj.qs` searches from the path provided to its folder, to the folder's parent folder,
to parent folder's parent folder, and so on; until it finds the prj.yaml file.
Hence we can use `__file__` variable in any .py file of the project.

The project can also be set up via python interactive mode in cmd (open cmd and enter "python"):

```
>>>import prj
>>>P = prj.setup(full_path_to_MYPROJECT_directory)
>>>import myproject.test.test_foo as test_foo
>>>test_foo.test_this_function()
```
 
## ABOUT prj.yaml

The following parameters are accepted:

```
name: MYPROJECT
author: binares
version: 0.1.0

#--Source directories--
#These must be relative paths to $PRJPATH (i.e. $PRJPATH\..\ is not allowed)
srcDirs:
 - $PRJPATH
 - $PRJPATH\myproject\test
 
#The $PRJPATH variable can be omitted:
#srcDirs:
# - .
# - myproject\test 

#If srcDirs is left undeclared (or srcDirs: null), then it will be replaced with ["$PRJPATH"].
#srcDirs: null -> srcDirs: ["$PRJPATH"]
#To leavy it empty declare it as empty list
#srcDirs: []
 
#--External libraries--
extLibs:
 - $PRJPATH\..\MY_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY
 
#--Data directories--
data: E:\PROJECTDATA\$PRJNAME
myData: E:\MY_SECRET_PASSWORDS

#--Path variables--
#The path variables start with $
#Accepted variables:
# $PRJPATH = $PPATH - full_path_to_MYPROJECT_directory
# $PRJDIRNAME - the directory name in which prj.yaml is located
# $PRJNAME - the name parameter (if no name provided then $PRJDIRNAME is used)
# $DRIVE - searches through all logical drives for the trailing path
# (e.g. $DRIVE:\SOME_FOLDER); returns first found

#Variables can be combined too:
# $DRIVE:\$PRJNAME

#They are replaced when Project object is initiated:
#E:\PROJECTDATA\$PRJNAME -> E:\PROJECTDATA\MYPROJECT
```

The Project object that was initiated now contains the following attribute-values:

```
P.ppath = path_to_MYPROJECT
P.dpath = "E:\\PROJECTDATA\\MYPROJECT"
P.mdpath = "E:\\MY_SECRET_PASSWORDS"
P.srcDirs = [path_to_MYPROJECT, path_to_MYPROJECT\myproject\test]
P.extLibs = [path_to_MY_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES]
P.name = "MYPROJECT"
P.author = "binares"
P.version = "0.1.0"
```

After initiating a project, the sys.path will look like this:<br />
`[*srcDirs from first to last, *extLibs from first to last, *the old sys.path[1:]]`

Note: practically the file can left empty, in which case the attributes will be assigned:<br />
```
P.ppath = path_to_MYPROJECT
P.srcDirs = [path_to_MYPROJECT]
P.name = "MYPROJECT"

sys.path = [path_to_MYPROJECT, *the old sys.path[1:]]
```

## FUNCTIONS

`prj.qs(_file_, ins_to='sys.path', build='if_not_implemented', replace_null_srcDirs=['$PRJPATH'])`

`prj.setup(path, procedure='from_defaults', astype='$PPATH', ins_to='sys.path', 
           build=True, parent_prj=None, replace_null_srcDirs=['$PRJPATH']):`
           
Both initiate a project. `prj.qs` searches the _prj.yaml_ file upstream in `_file_`'s parent directories. `prj.setup` requires you to provide full `path` to the project's folder. If project is already initated (='implemented'), returns the already initiated project and builds paths (inserts them to `ins_to`) only if `build` is set to `True`. 

The first time qs/setup is called, sys.path[0] (directory where python file was run) is deleted. To prevent that, call `prj.set_delete_sys_path_index(None)` before calling qs/setup. Custom index must also be set if you have inserted custom paths to sys.path before calling qs/setup; in that case set the index to `the_number_of_custom_paths_inserted` or `None`.

`prj.set_delete_sys_path_index(value)`

Explained above. Example: 

```
import prj,sys
sys.path.insert(0,'C:\my_external_python_library')
prj.set_delete_sys_path_index(1)
P = prj.qs(__file__)
```

`prj.get_prj(name=None, path=None)`

Retrieve an initiated project object by its name or path (all initiated projects are stored in memory). If `path` is provided, tries to retrieve by `path` first.
          
`prj.zip_contents(path,destination=None,compression='ZIP_DEFLATED',
                 include_pycache=False, exists='error')`
                 
Usage: `prj.zip_contents("C:\\MYPROJECT")` - creates zip file *C:\\MYPROJECT.zip* 
containing C:\\MYPROJECT contents. Can be any directory (not only those containing prj.yaml).
   
`prj.Project.archive(self, package=None, destination='$PRJPATH\\..\\_backup',
                    compression='ZIP_DEFLATED', include_pycache=False,
                    exists='rename')`
                    
same as zip_contents, but does so directly for the project at hand.
