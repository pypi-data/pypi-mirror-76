Description: # Rotten Tomatoes Scraper 
        
        You can extract information about movies and actors that are listed on the Rotten Tomatoes website using this service. 
        Each movie has different metadata such as *Rating*, *Genre*, *Box Office*, or *Studio*. Note that the **Genre** 
        has 20+ subcategories that also gives you more granular information on a movie. These metadata can be helpful for many 
        purposes; however, I could not find a clean API to provide you all these metadata. For an actor you can extract movies 
        listed in **highest-rated** or **filmography** sections depending on your need. I used the BeautifulSoup 
        package to parse HTML documents obtained by the HTTP response in this library. 
        
        
        ## Library
        The library requires the following libraries:
        
        * bs4
        * re
        * requests
        * urllib
        
        ## Install
        
        It can be installed using pip:
        ```python
        pip3 install rotten_tomatoes_scraper
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        You can use this library to extract the complete list of movies that an actor played by calling `extract_movies` method
        and using `section='filmography'`. Plus, you can also extract the list of top ranked movies by using the same method and
        `section='highest'`. 
        
        ```python
        from rotten_tomatoes_scraper.rt_scraper import RTScraper
        
        rts = RTScraper()
        movie_titles = rts.extract_movies('jack nicholson', section='highest')
        
        print(movie_titles)
        ['Kubrick by Kubrick (Kubrick par Kubrick)', 'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever', 'The Shooting']
        ```
        
        If you want to find out what movie genres an actor has played in, you can, first, extract the list of movies that he or 
        she played in using `extract_movies` method. Then, you just need to feed in the list of movies to the `extract_genre` 
        method to receive a dictionary that keys are movie genres and values are the number oof movies with that genre in which 
        the actor played. You can easily use the code below.
        
        ```python
        from rotten_tomatoes_scraper.rt_scraper import RTScraper
        
        rts = RTScraper()
        movie_titles = rts.extract_movies('meryl streep', section='highest')
        movie_genres = rts.extract_genre(movie_titles)
        
        print(movie_genres)
        {'Documentary': 2, 'Comedy': 1, 'ScienceFiction&Fantasy': 1, 'Drama': 1, 'Romance': 1}
        ```
        
        This library doesn't give you a full access to all the metadata that you may find in Rotten Tomatoes website. However,
        you can easily use it to extract the most important ones.
        
        And, that's pretty much it!
