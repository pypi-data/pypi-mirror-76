    """
    A "Phase Screen" for use in AO simulation.  Can be extruded infinitely.

    This represents the phase addition light experiences when passing through atmospheric 
    turbulence. Unlike other phase screen generation techniques that translate a large static 
    screen, this method keeps a small section of phase, and extends it as necessary for as many
    steps as required. This can significantly reduce memory consumption at the expense of more
    processing power required.

    The technique is described in a paper by Assemat and Wilson, 2006 and expanded upon by Fried, 2008.
    It essentially assumes that there are two matrices, "A" and "B",
    that can be used to extend an existing phase screen.
    A single row or column of new phase can be represented by 

        X = A.Z + B.b

    where X is the new phase vector, Z is some data from the existing screen,
    and b is a random vector with gaussian statistics.

    This object calculates the A and B matrices using an expression of the phase covariance when it
    is initialised. Calculating A is straightforward through the relationship:

        A =  Cov_xz . (Cov_zz)^(-1).

    B is less trivial.

        BB^t = Cov_xx - A.Cov_zx

    (where B^t is the transpose of B) is a symmetric matrix, hence B can be expressed as 

        B = UL, 

    where U and L are obtained from the svd for BB^t

        U, w, U^t = svd(BB^t)

    L is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal elements are w^(1/2).    

    On initialisation an initial phase screen is calculated using an FFT based method.
    When 'add_row' is called, a new vector of phase is added to the phase screen.

    Existing points to use are defined by a "stencil", than is set to 0 for points not to use
    and 1 for points to use. This makes this a generalised base class that can be used by 
    other infinite phase screen creation schemes, such as for Von Karmon turbulence or 
    Kolmogorov turbulence.
