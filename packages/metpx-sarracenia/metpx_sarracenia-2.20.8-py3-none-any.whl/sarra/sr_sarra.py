# usage example
#
# sr_sarra [options] [config] [foreground|start|stop|restart|reload|status|cleanup|setup]
#
# sr_sarra consumes message, for each message it downloads the product
# and reannounce it. On usage of sarra is to acquire data from source
# that announce their products.  The other usage is to dessiminate products
# from other brokers/pumps.
#
# condition 1: from a source
# broker                  = where sarra is running (manager)
# exchange                = xs_source_user
# product                 = downloaded under directory (option document_root)
#                         = subdirectory from mirror option  OR
#                           message.headers['rename'] ...
#                           can be trimmed by option  strip
#
# post_broker             = where sarra is running (manager)
# post_exchange           = xpublic
# post_message            = same as incoming message
#                           message.headers['source']  is set from source_user
#                           message.headers['cluster'] is set from option cluster from default.conf
#                           message is built from url option give
#
# report_exchange         = xreport
#
#
# condition 2: from another broker/pump
# broker                  = the remote broker...
# exchange                = xpublic
# product                 = usually the product placement is mirrored 
#                           option document_root needs to be set
# post_broker             = where sarra is running (manager)
# post_exchange           = xpublic
# post_message            = same as incoming message
#                           message.headers['source']  left as is
#                           message.headers['cluster'] left as is 
#                           option url : gives new url announcement for this product
