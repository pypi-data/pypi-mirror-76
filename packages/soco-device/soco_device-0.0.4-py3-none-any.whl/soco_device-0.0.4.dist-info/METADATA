# soco-device
A package for logging, saving, and automatically choosing device during model inference stage.

# Usage
1. install package

    pip install soco-device


2. example usage
```
from soco_device import DeviceCheck

dc = DeviceCheck()
device_name = dc.get_device_by_model(model_name_or_path)
device = torch.device(device_name)

dc.log_start()
# inference model for one time here
dc.log_end()
dc.save(model_name_or_path)
```
