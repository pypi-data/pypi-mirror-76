        Datasette plugin that lets users save and execute queries
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette.
        
            $ pip install datasette-saved-queries
        
        ## Usage
        
        When the plugin is installed Datasette will automatically create a `saved_queries` table in the first connected database when it starts up.
        
        It also creates a `save_query` writable canned query which you can use to save new queries.
        
        Queries that you save will be added to the query list on the database page.
        
        ## Development
        
        To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
        
            cd datasette-saved-queries
            python -mvenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Or if you are using `pipenv`:
        
            pipenv shell
        
        Now install the dependencies and tests:
        
            pip install -e '.[test]'
        
        To run the tests:
        
            pytest
