        ## Introduction
        
        While timelapse videos can be created from regular video footage a more
        professional approach would be to take a series of still photos. This allows to
        control parameters like exposure length, interval length and thus the [shutter
        angle](https://beyondthetime.net/cinematic-motion-blur-180-rule/). I won't dig
        any deeper here, because this is not the objective of this document and there
        is plenty of information out there.
        
        Now, imagine you have hundreds or even thousands of RAW pictures. All of them
        need some sort of processing and in the non-free world people would quickly turn
        to Lightroom and LRTimelapse which are undoubtly great tools. But not
        everybody's running Windows or MacOS and there are some great open source
        alternatives like [darktable](http://www.darktable.org). What's missing though
        is a tool which, just like LRTimelapse, helps with the editing of all those
        pictures based on keyframes. That's where **dtLapse** comes into play!
        
        A word of warning: This tool does not replace a solid knowledge of *darktable*
        and it's editing workflows. For a starting point I recommend the [darktable
        manual](https://www.darktable.org/resources/), the [darktable-user mailing
        list](https://www.mail-archive.com/darktable-user@lists.darktable.org/) and the
        [pixls.us (inofficial)](https://discuss.pixls.us/) website.

        ## Motivational Example
        
        Let's assume you've taken a (very short) timelapse consisting of 10 frames. If
        you'd take your pictures as they were using an automatic algorithm (e.g. your
        camera's jpeg routine) you might notice that brightness and color flicker. This
        does not happen always and depends heavily on how well your camera's light meter
        and white balance algorithm works but it happens.
        
        Back to your frames. You start working on your first frame in darktable and once
        you've got a result you're happy with you just copy the entire history stack
        over to your other pictures.
        
        But NO, what just happened? The highlights are blown out and the colors look
        totally off, even stronger for every picture. The lighting conditions changed
        rapidly during your shot and your edit of the first frame doesn't fit your last
        frame. How can you fix that without tediously working on every single frame?
        
        It's actually pretty easy! You just declare frames 1,4,7 and 10 as keyframes, do
        your editing there and interpolate the module parameters for 2,3,5,6,8 and 9.
        So, instead of editing 10 frames, you're now down to 4.
        
        ## Key-what? (Keyframes)
        
        A **keyframe** is a special frame (photo, picture) which has been picked in
        advance to represent a set of similar pictures. This sounds complicated at first
        but actually it's pretty simple. When you open up *darktable* and load your
        stills you're presented with thumbnails for all of them. Now you can select
        every Nth frame and tag them. For example `Keyframe`, which is the default
        *dtLapse* will look for, but you can also use a different tag. The amount of
        keyframes depends on the amount of work you're willing to put into your
        timelapse and most importantly how rapidly the light changes. For around 1300
        pictures I've had good success with 30 to 40 keyframes. You can also add more
        keyframes for time spans where the light changes quickly, e.g. sunrise or sunset
        and fewer for very constant footage. Always ensure to include the very first and
        the last frame!
        
        ## Workflow
        
        Now that you've got a bunch of keyframes you can start working on them
        individually. Use the `collect image` module to narrow down to your keyframes
        only.
        
        First thing you might want to fix is the `white balance`. Color temperature
        usually only changes for day-to-night or night-to-day shots, so be sure to put
        an emphasis here if you captured that. In addition, sometimes the auto white
        balance mode of (at least my) camera fails which can result in ugly color
        flicker. To fix this, adjust the color balance for all your keyframes to get
        a consistent look across them.
        
        Next thing would be `exposure`. Here, too, flicker is the main problem, e.g.
        when your camera adjust exposure time or ISO too rapidly or even randomly.
        I recommend to use *darktable*'s auto exposure mode and start from there. Again,
        aim for a consistent look throughout your keyframes.
        
        Now that the basics are fixed you can start to use `filmicrgb` to adjust shadows
        and highlights. After that I usually carry on with `local contrast`, `rgb
        curve`, `color balance`, `vibrance` and `velvia`. For extreme cases of bright
        and dark scenes `graduatednd` might help, but usually `filmicrgb` does a better
        job. As above, aim for a consistent look across your keyframes.
        
        Once you are happy with the look of your keyframes, make sure to save all the
        XMPs (`write sidecar files`). Now you can close *darktable* (or minimize it) and
        open a terminal. Navigate to the directory which holds your XMP files and run
        *dtLapse* with the `--plot` option:
        
        ```
        $ dtlapse temperature --xmps ${my_xmps} --plot
        ```
        
        (This requires your keyframes to be tagged with `Keyframe`. If that's not the
        case you can use either the `--keyframe-tag` option to specify a different
        keyframe or specify the keyframes manually with the `--keyframes` option.)
        
        Now you should see a window with a plotted curve of the interpolated and
        smoothed values between your keyframes. If you're happy with the result, close
        the window and run *dtLapse* again without the `--plot` option:
        
        ```
        $ dtlapse temperature --xmps ${my_xmps}
        ```
        
        *DtLapse* will now write the calculated values to the XMP files. If you did not
        specify the `--no-backup` option then every XMP will be copied with a `.bkp`
        suffix.
        
        Repeat this for every module you've made modifications with and which is
        supported by *dtLapse*. For a list of supported modules run `dtlapse --help` or
        look into the `iops` directory.
        
        Finally, you need to reload the XMP files in *darktable*. Just re-import all
        pictures from your timelapse and *darktable* should pick up the changes. If that
        does not work you close *darktable* before running *dtlapse*. If you still
        experience problems, make sure that *darktable* does not give precedence to it's
        database rather than the XMP files.
        
        ## Tl;Dr
        
        1. Load your timelapse pictures in *darktable*.
        2. Pick some keyframes. Always include the very first and the last frame.
        3. Tag you keyframes, e.g. with `Keyframe`.
        4. Edit your keyframes using the modules supported by *dtLapse*.
        5. Save the XMP sidecar files (`write sidecar files`) or close *darktable*.
        6. Run *dtLapse* with the `--plot` switch, check the curve and (if necessary)
           tweak it using the `--interpolation`, `--smooth` and `--window` & `--order`
           parameters.
        7. Once you're happy with the graph, run *dtLapse* without the `--plot` switch
           to apply the modifications to your XMP files.
        8. Reload your pictures (`import` module) or open up *darktable* again.
        9. Check if you like the result.
        10. Export your pictures or tweak your keyframes and run *dtLapse* again.
        
        ## Usage examples
        
        ```
        $ dtlapse temperature --xmps ${my_xmps} --plot
        ```
        Plot a graph of the interpolated values for the temperature module.
        
        ```
        $ dtlapse temperature --xmps ${my_xmps} --interpolation cubic --plot
        ```
        Use a different interpolation algorithm instead of the default `quadratic`.
        
        ```
        $ dtlapse temperature --xmps ${my_xmps} --smooth --plot
        ```
        Add smoothing to the interpolated values and plot the graph again.
        
        ```
        $ dtlapse temperature --xmps ${my_xmps} --smooth --window 101 --order 5 --plot
        ```
        Adjust smoothing parameters and plot the graph.
        
        ```
        $ dtlapse temperature --xmps ${my_xmps} --keyframe-tag MyKeyframeTag --dry-run
        ```
        Use a different tag instead of the default `Keyframe`.
        
        ```
        $ dtlapse temperature --xmps ${my_xmps} --keyframes ${my_keyframe_xmps} --dry-run
        ```
        Specify keyframes manually without the use of a tag.
        
        ## Adding more modules
        
        Adding modules is actually pretty easy. Let's assume there's a module you'd like
        to add. Go to *darktable*'s git repository, find the module in the `src/iop`
        directory and open the file, for example `exposure.c`. There you will find
        a data structure called `dt_iop_exposure_params_t`. For the `temperature` module
        it's called `dt_iop_temperature_params_t`. You get the idea. Now, when you look
        at the `iops/exposure.json` in this repository you'll see a data entry called
        `smooth` and `cformat`. The `smooth` field contains a list of boolean values
        which tell *dtLapse* whether the parameter should be interpolated and smoothed
        or not. For example in the `exposure` module the first data value is a switch
        for the module mode which we do not want to be interpolated. Hence it's set to
        false. The `cformat` field species the data value types for the struct.  For the
        `exposure` module it's `int`, `float`, `float`, `float` and `float` (`iffff`).
        Check pythons `struct` module for
        [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) on how to specify
        types. Finally you'll need the proper name of the module for the `operation`
        data field, the `modversion` and the `iop_order`. The `modversion` for a certain
        darktable release can be found in a macro called `DT_MODULE_INTROSPECTION` in
        the module source file. The `modversion` is especially important to distinguish
        between different module version with different parameter sets. New versions can
        be easily added to the `iopdata` list. For the `iop_order` I have not found
        a better way than to look at an XMP file. Finally, please write a somewhat
        meaningful help text.  Drop your now module.json file into the `iops` folder and
        it should be available.
        
        ```
        DT_MODULE_INTROSPECTION(5, dt_iop_exposure_params_t)
        ```
        
        For more complex modules and parameters python's eval mode can be used to
        specify `smooth` and `cformat`. Just prefix the string with `eval:`. For an
        example, take a look at `filmicrgb.json`.
        
        ```
        typedef struct dt_iop_exposure_params_t
        {
          dt_iop_exposure_mode_t mode; // $DEFAULT: EXPOSURE_MODE_MANUAL
          float black;    // $MIN: -1.0 $MAX: 1.0 $DEFAULT: 0.0 $DESCRIPTION: "black level correction"
          float exposure; // $MIN: -18.0 $MAX: 18.0 $DEFAULT: 0.0
          float deflicker_percentile;   // $MIN: 0.0 $MAX: 100.0 $DEFAULT: 50.0 $DESCRIPTION: "percentile"
          float deflicker_target_level; // $MIN: -18.0 $MAX: 18.0 $DEFAULT: -4.0 $DESCRIPTION: "target level"
          int compensate_exposure_bias; // $DEFAULT: FALSE
        } dt_iop_exposure_params_t;
        ```

        ## Tipps & Tricks
        
        - Every image must have an existing XMP file. Run *darktable* first, then
          *dtLapse*.
        
        - Include the first and the last frame in your keyframes!
        
        - Every keyframe must have the module enabled you're planing to use, even if you
          leave it at default settings. For the rest of the images it's not necessary.
        
        - If you want to use multiple modules, simply use a `for` loop:
        
        ``` zsh
        for op in exposure temperature filmicrgb; do
          dtlapse ${op} --xmps ${xmps}
        done
        ```
        
        - The `--xmp` parameter does only accept XMP files. You can use shell globbing
          to match all your files. Either copy all pictures to particular folder and use
          `--xmps *.xmp`, or (like I do) leave a your camera's sequence number in the
          filename and use something like `--xmps *{00013..00314}.xmp`.
        
        - If darktable is acting strangly or overwrites your XMPs, run it without the
          database: darktable --library :memory:
        
        - Suppose you have all your timelapse pictures (and nothing else) in one folder,
          e.g. /path/to/my/timelapse.  Then you just do this:
        
        ``` zsh
        $ cd /path/to/my/timelapse
        $ darktable .
        # or
        $ darktable *.arw # *.nef *.cr2 or what you're using
        # edit edit edit
        $ dtlapse ${operation} --xmps *.xmp # --plot --smooth --window --order etc
        $ darktable . # or ..
        ```

        #### Parameters
        
        | Parameter | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | `--dry-run` | Do not modify XMP files. |
        | `--no-backup` | By default all XMP files will be copied to a new file with the suffix "*.bkp".  Use this flag to disable this behaviour. |
        | `--plot` | Plot a graph for fine tuning parameters. XMPs will not be modified. |
        | `--xmps` | XMP files. Mandatory. |
        | `--keyframes` | A list of XMP files which serve as keyframes. If this is used, keyframe tags will be ignored, even if specified with the --keyframe-tag switch. |
        | `--keyframe-tag` | Tag used for selecting Keyframes. Default: "Keyframe". |
        | `--interpolation` | Interpolation method. One of linear, nearest, zero, slinear, quadratic, cubic, previous, next. See scipy.interpolate.interp1d documentation for details.  Default: quadratic. |
        | `--smooth` | Use a Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth the data points. Use --window and --order to fine tune the result. |
        | `--window` | Window size for the smoothing filter. Must be odd. Default: length of input values. Greater values result in more smoothing. |
        | `--order` | The order of the polynom for the filter function. Smaller values result in more smoothing. Default value: 3. |
