# Git-NetworkX

### Port of https://github.com/hoduche/git-graph to NetworkX

---

## Install

### PyPi

`pip install git-networkx`

### Git

`pip install git+https://github.com/CircArgs/git-networkx.git`

## Demo

```python
from networkx.drawing.nx_pydot import write_dot
from git_networkx import GitNX, Commit
#everything
All = gnx.GitNX('my/repo/path/that/has/a/.git')
write_dot(All, "myrepo.dot")

#Commits
Commits = gnx.GitNX('my/repo/path/that/has/a/.git', "c")
write_dot(Commits, "mycommits.dot")

#which is equivalent to the subgraph obtained by (not in terms of ops)
[n for n in All if isinstance(n, Commit)]

```

## Node Types

| Node Type     | Letter | Node Type     | Letter |
| ------------- | :----: | ------------- | :----: |
| blob          |   b    | remote branch |   r    |
| tree          |   t    | remote head   |   d    |
| commit        |   c    | remote server |   s    |
| local branch  |   l    | annotated tag |   a    |
| local head    |   h    | tag           |   g    |
| upstream link |   u    |

By default all nodes are added to the DiGraph.

```python
# you can get your commits, branches and the head of your local repo simply with lch
G=gnx.GitNX('../git_networkx_test/', "lch")

```
