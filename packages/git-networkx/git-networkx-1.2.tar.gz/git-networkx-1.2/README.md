that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.](https://git-scm.com/docs/git)

As wonderful as it may be, there is a downside coming with this "unusually rich command set", a kind of anxiety that affects beginners in particular and can be summed up in one question:
> "What the hell is going to happen to my repository if I launch this Git command ?"

A good way to overcome this difficulty is to experiment.
This is made easy thanks to Git lightness and the fact it is immediately up and running in any directory with `git init`.

Git-graph is a Git plugin, written in Python, that displays your Git repository inner content as a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG).
This structured visual representation of Git internal data demystifies the impact of each Git command and considerably improves the learning curve.

## Install

#### From PyPI
To install Git-graph from PyPI:
1. You first need to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) and check that the dot binary is correctly set in you system's path.  
2. Then run: 
    ```
    pip install git-graph
    ```

#### From GitHub
To install Git-graph from GitHub:
1. You first need to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) and check that the dot binary is correctly set in you system's path.  
2. Then run:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hoduche/git-graph
    ```
3. Finally, inside the newly created git-graph folder, run (with Python 3 and setuptools):
    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```

## Run

#### As a Git plugin
Git-graph is a Git plugin that is run from a Git repository with the command:
```
git graph
```

Running `git graph` from a Git repository will:
1. scan your `.git` folder
2. build and save a graph representation of the `.git` folder internals as text (`.dot`) and image (PDF by default) in a `.gitGraph` folder
3. popup a window that displays the image of your graph

A color code helps in distinguishing in the graph the different kinds of object Git is using in its implementation:

| Object kind    | Letter | Representation                                     | Object kind    | Letter | Representation                                     |
| -------------- | :----: | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | :----: | -------------------------------------------------- |
| blob           | b      | ![blob](doc/sample_blob.dot.svg)                   | remote branch  | r      | ![remote_branch](doc/sample_remote_branch.dot.svg) |
| tree           | t      | ![tree](doc/sample_tree.dot.svg)                   | remote head    | d      | ![remote_head](doc/sample_remote_head.dot.svg)     |
| commit         | c      | ![commit](doc/sample_commit.dot.svg)               | remote server  | s      | ![remote_server](doc/sample_remote_server.dot.svg) |
| local branch   | l      | ![local_branch](doc/sample_local_branch.dot.svg)   | annotated tag  | a      | ![annotated_tag](doc/sample_annotated_tag.dot.svg) |
| local head     | h      | ![local_head](doc/sample_local_head.dot.svg)       | tag            | g      | ![tag](doc/sample_tag.dot.svg)                     |
| upstream link  | u      | ![upstream](doc/sample_upstream.dot.svg)           |

By default all nodes are displayed in the output graph when running `git graph`.
It is possible to only display a user selection of object kinds using the `-n` or `--nodes` option and picking the letters corresponding to your choice.   
For instance to only display blobs, trees and commits:
```
git graph -n btc
```

By default Git-graph considers it is launched from a Git repository.
It is possible to indicate the path to another Git repository with the `-p` or `--path` option:
```
git graph -p examples/demo
```

The default output format is PDF.
Other output graphics formats (either vector or raster) can be set with the `-f` or `--format` option:  
(the full list of possible formats can be found on the [Graphviz documentation website](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/output.html))
```
git graph -f svg
```

Finally it is possible to prevent the graph image from poping up once constructed, with the `-c` or `--conceal` option:
```
git graph -c
```

#### As a Python program
```
python git_graph/cli.py -p examples/demo -n btc -f svg
```
or
```
./git_graph/cli.py -p examples/demo -n btc -f svg
```

#### As a Python module

```python
import git_graph.dot_graph as dg
dg.DotGraph('..').persist()
dg.DotGraph('../examples/demo', nodes='btc').persist(form='svg', conceal=True)
```
