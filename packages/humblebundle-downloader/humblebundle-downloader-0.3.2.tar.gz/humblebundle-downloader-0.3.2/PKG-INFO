        **Download all of your content from your Humble Bundle Library!**  
        
        The first time this runs it may take a while because it will download everything. After that it will only download the content that has been updated or is missing.  
        
        ## Features
        - support for Humble Trove _(`--trove` flag)_
        - downloads new and updated content from your Humble Bundle Library on each run _(only check for updates if using `--update`)_
        - cli command for easy use (downloading will also work on a headless system)
        - works for SSO and 2FA accounts
        - optional progress bar for each item downloaded _(`--progress` flag)_
        - optional filter by file types using an include _or_ exclude list _(`--include/--exclude` flag)_
        - optional filter by platform types like video, ebook, etc... _(`--platform` flag)_
        
        
        ## Install
        `pip install humblebundle-downloader`
        
        
        ## Instructions
        
        ### 1. Getting cookies
        First thing to do is get your account cookies. The cookies should be in the Netscape format. You can get them by using a browser extension. These are the ones that I tested, but others may work as well...  
        - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies-txt/
        - Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookiestxt/njabckikapfpffapmjgojcnbfjonfjfg/
        
        ### 2. Downloading your library
        Use the following command to download your Humble Bundle Library:  
        `hbd download --cookie-file cookies.txt --library-path "Downloaded Library" --progress`  
        
        This directory structure will be used:  
        `Downloaded Library/Purchase Name/Item Name/downloaded_file.ext`
        
        
        ## Notes
        * Inside your library folder a file named `.cache.json` is saved and keeps track of the files that have been downloaded. This way running the download command again pointing to the same directory will only download new or updated files.
        * Use `--help` with all `hbd` commands to see available options
        * Find supported platforms for the `--platform` flag by visiting your Humble Bundle Library and look under the **Platform** dropdown
        * Download select bundles by using the `-k` or `--keys` flag. Find these keys by going to your *Purchases* section, click on a products and there should be a `downloads?key=XXXX` in the url.
