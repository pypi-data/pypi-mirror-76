This package is made to fast prototype your multimedia applications like games on pygame. 
Write clean and pragmatic design. It lets you focus on the game engine itself, so you don't have
to take care about several details like setting up the window, loading and checking data (images,
sound, font, fx, music, resources names...).
All you need to do is to put your resources into a specific data folder and use them 
in your game class 'MyEngine()'.

You don't need to reinvent the wheel, some repetitive parts of code (main loop, getting the delta time, 
closing the window, drawing text...) are already described and ready to use in the 
default engine.

     1)- Environment class:
         This is the first class to call on your main file, to set the
         pygame environment.
         By default the pygame display,the mixer and the font are initialized.

     2)- load_complete(self, instance, dataFolder=None, fileLevels=None):
         This is the second thing to call on your main file
         to load your resources if any.(see load_complete for parameters
         description).

     # Note that this is important to respect the following scheme
     for all types of game:
         1- Set the environment
         2- load all resources only once.
         3- main loop function called by an instance of your game engine.
         4- at the end of the game destroy resources and quit the environment.
         Your main file should always look like the following example:

## Usage example

```python
>>> from laylib import Environment
>>> from engine import Engine
>>>
>>> def main():
>>>     demo = Environment(800, 600, False, 'My game')
>>>     demo.load_complete(Engine(), 'data', 'resources.bin')
>>>     demo.gInstance.main_loop()
>>>     demo.destroy()

>>> if __name__ == "__main__":
>>>     main()
```

        1) - _load_game(dataFolder, persistenceLayer):
        this function load game resources and get infos from persistence
        layer, this function must call the Resources class to load all the
        data from the data folder.
        optional if you have no data to load. Just keep it empty
        by default on the engine.

        #PARAMS:
        * dataFolder: this folder contains all the resources:(sound,
        images font..etc)

        * persistenceLayer: this file contains the data structure of all
        resources. It will be created automatically after calling the
        class Resources(data_folder).save(persistenceLayer)

        2) - _destroy_game(): at the end destroy all resources if necessary
        3) - main_loop(): the main loop of the game(event, update, draw...
        ticks).
        4) - _load_levels(): useful if the game contains levels. optional
        if no levels to load. keep it empty on the engine
