This package is made to fast prototype your multimedia applications like games on pygame. 
Write clean and pragmatic design. It lets you focus on the game engine itself, so you don't have
to take care about several details like setting up the window, loading and checking data (images,
sound, font, fx, music, resources names...).
All you need to do is to put your resources into a specific data folder and use them 
in your game class 'MyEngine()'.

You don't need to reinvent the wheel, some repetitive parts of code (main loop, getting the delta time, 
closing the window, drawing text...) are already described and ready to use in the 
default engine.

    
Usage example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from laylib import Environment
    from engine import Engine

    def main():
	demo = Environment(800, 600, False, 'My game')
	demo.load_complete(Engine(), 'data', 'resources.res')
	demo.gInstance.main_loop()
	demo.destroy()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()

	
INSTALLATION
------------

First, install the dependencies:
- Python3 (3.5 or later) <http://www.python.org>
- Pygame 1.9.1 or later <http://pygame.org/download.shtml>
Or run in terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then install laylib: 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install laylib

Or alternatively, you can just copy the "laylib" folder into the same
directory as the Python program that uses it.
