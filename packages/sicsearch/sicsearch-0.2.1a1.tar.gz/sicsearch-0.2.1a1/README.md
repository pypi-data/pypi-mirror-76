# Safe in Cloud DB Search

This utility make it easy to search a previously created *Safe in Cloud*
database. At this point this is just a quick hack to use *SIC* in a Linux
environment.

## Open the database

Use the installed script to open the specified database. The script will prompt
for your database password and open the database.

```bash
sicsearch ~/SafeInCloud.db
```

## Searching

### Fuzzy matching

At the blue `>` prompt start typing your search term. The script will use a
fuzzy match algorithm to filter out the entries as you type.

### Content matching

If your query is three or more characters long the script will also search
inside each entry and display which field matched in parenthesis.

shutdown to prevent keeping the database open.
