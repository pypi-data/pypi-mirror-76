Neosensory Python SDK
=====================

A Python package for interacting with Neosensory products. This is designed to work with `Bleak <https://github.com/hbldh/bleak>`_, a cross-platform Python Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) client for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Please see the Bleak project page for more specifics on supported platforms. **IMPORTANT: At the moment this is tested and only working on Windows.**

Requirements
============
This SDK relies on `Bleak <https://github.com/hbldh/bleak>`_ to take care of the underlying Bluetooth low energy shenanigans. It is included as a dependency and should get automatically installed if using pip or setup.py.

Installation
============

you can clone this repo and run

.. code-block:: bash

	python setup.py develop

from within the root directory.


Usage
=====
You may need to first pair your Neosensory Buzz in advance with your operating system (OS). To do so, find your OS's Bluetooth settings/panel and follow its instructions for pairing a new device. To put Buzz into pairing mode, hold down the (+) and (-) buttons until the LEDs flash blue.

See this repo's `examples <https://github.com/neosensory/neosensory-sdk-for-python/tree/master/examples>`_ directory to get up and running quickly.
