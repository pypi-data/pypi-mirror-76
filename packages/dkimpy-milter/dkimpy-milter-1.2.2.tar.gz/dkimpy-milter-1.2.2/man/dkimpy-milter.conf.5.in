.TH dkimpy-milter.conf 5 "2019-04-25"
.SH "NAME"
dkimpy-milter \- Python milter for DKIM signing and validation
.SH "VERSION"
1\.2\.0

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I dkimpy-milter(8)
implements the
.B DKIM
specification for signing and verifying e-mail messages on a per-domain
basis.  This file is its configuration file.

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines containing a hash ("#") character are
truncated at the hash character to allow for comments in the file.

Other content should be the name of a parameter, followed by white space,
followed by the value of that parameter, each on a separate line.

For parameters that are Boolean in nature, only the first byte of
the value is processed.  For positive values, the following are accepted:
"T", "t", "Y", "y", "1".  For negative values, the following are accepted:
"F", "f", "N", "n", "0".

The provided setup.py installs this configuration file in /etc or
/usr/local/etc based on the value of expand sysconfigdir= used when the
package was installed.

Command line invocation of parameters as is done by OpenDKIM is not supported.

.SH "USAGE"
Usage:
  dkimpy-milter [@CONFDIR@/dkimpy-milter.conf]

.SH "OTHER DOCUMENTATION"
This documentation assumes you have read Postfix's README_FILES/MILTER_README
(or Sendmail equivalent) and are generally familiar with Domain Keys Identified
Mail (DKIM).  See RFC 6376 for details.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"

dkimpy-milter operates with a default installed configuration file and 
set of default configuration options that are used if the configuration file
cannot be found.  These options can be changed by changing the installed 
configuration files.  For users transitioning from OpenDKIM, OpenDKIM config
files can be used directly.  Not all OpenDKIM options are supported.  If an
unsupported option from OpenDKIM is specified, an error will be raised.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Configuration options are described here and in the configuration file 
provided with the package.  The provided setup.py installs this configuration 
file in /etc or /usr/local/etc.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
.I AuthservID (string)
Sets the "authserv-id" to use when generating the Authentication-Results:
header field after verifying a message.  The default is to use the name of
the MTA processing the message.  If the string "HOSTNAME" is provided, the
name of the host running the filter (as returned by the
.I gethostname(3)
function) will be used.

.TP
.I Canonicalization (string)
Selects the canonicalization method(s) to be used when signing messages.
When verifying, the message's DKIM-Signature: header field specifies
the canonicalization method.  The recognized values are
.I relaxed
and
.I simple
as defined by the DKIM specification.  The default is
.I relaxed
/
.I simple.
The value may include two different canonicalizations separated by a
slash ("/") character, in which case the first will be applied to the
header and the second to the body.

.TP
.I DiagnosticDirectory (string)
Directory into which to write diagnostic reports when message verification
fails.  If not set (the default), these files are not generated.  The
directory must exist, dkimpy-milter will not create it and an error will be
raised if it does not.  [Unlike OpenDKIM, this applies to all messages, not
just  on messages bearing a "z=" tag because dkimpy does not yet support
"z=" processing.]

.TP
.I Domain (dataset)
A set of domains whose mail should be signed by this filter.  Mail from other
domains will be verified rather than being signed.

This parameter is not required if a
.I SigningTable
is in use; in that case, the list of signed domains is implied by the
lines in that file.

This parameter is ignored if a
.I KeyTable
or
.I KeyTableD25119
is defined.

.TP
.I InternalHosts (dataset)
Identifies a set internal hosts whose mail should be signed rather
than verified.  Entries in this data set follow the same form as those of
the
.I PeerList
option below.  If not specified, the default of "127.0.0.1" is applied.
Naturally, providing a value here overrides the default, so if mail from
127.0.0.1 should be signed, the list provided here should include that
address explicitly. [PeerList NOT IMPLEMENTED]

.TP
.I KeyFile (string)
Gives the location of a PEM-formatted private key to be used for RSA signing
all messages.  Ignored if a
.I KeyTable
is defined.

.TP
.I KeyFileEd25519 (string)
Gives the location of a Ed25519 private key to be used for Ed25519 signing
all messages.  File is the Base64 encoded output of RFC 8032 Ed25519 private Key
generation (as used in dkimpy).  Ignored if a 
.I KeyTableEd25519
is defined.

.TP
.I KeyTable (dataset)
Gives the location of a file mapping key names to RSA signing keys. If present, overrides any KeyFile setting in the configuration file. The data set named here maps each key name to three values: (a) the name of the domain to use in the signature’s "d=" value; (b) the name of the selector to use in the signature’s "s=" value; and (c) the  path to a file containing a private key. If the first value consists solely of a percent sign ("%") character, it will be replaced by the apparent domain of the sender when generating a signature. The third value must start with a slash ("/") character, or "./" or "../" to indicate it refers to a file from which the private key should be read.  The SigningTable (see below) is used to select records from this table to be used to add signatures based on the message sender.

See the COMPLEX SIGNING CONFIGURATIONS section of README.md for examples.

.TP
.I KeyTableEd25519 (dataset)
Gives the location of a file mapping key names to Ed25519 signing keys. If present, overrides any KeyFile setting in the configuration file. The data set named here maps each key name to three values: (a) the name of the domain to use in the signature’s "d=" value; (b) the name of the selector to use in the signature’s "s=" value; and (c) the  path to a file containing a private key. If the first value consists solely of a percent sign ("%") character, it will be replaced by the apparent domain of the sender when generating a signature. The third value must start with a slash ("/") character, or "./" or "../" to indicate it refers to a file from which the private key should be read.  The SigningTable (see below) is used to select records from this table to be used to add signatures based on the message sender.  NOTE: There is a limitation of the current implementation that a private key can't be directly included in the file if it starts with '/', './', or '../'.  If you have such a key, you may store it in a file and reference the file in the table.

See the COMPLEX SIGNING CONFIGURATIONS section of README.md for examples.

.TP
.I MacroList (dataset)
Defines a set of MTA-provided
.I macros
that should be checked to see if the sender has been determined to be a
local user and therefore whether or not the message should be signed.  If
a
.I value
is specified matching a macro name in the data set, the value of the macro
must match a value specified (matching is case-sensitive), otherwise the
macro must be defined but may contain any value.  The set is empty by
default, meaning macros are not considered when making the sign-verify
decision.  The general format of the value is
.I value1[|value2[|...]];
if one or more value is defined then the macro must be set to one of the
listed values, otherwise the macro must be set but can contain any
value.

In order for the macro and its value to be available to the filter for
checking, the MTA must send it during the protocol exchange.  This is either
accomplished via manual configuration of the MTA to send the desired macros
or, for MTA/filter combinations that support the feature, the filter can
request those macros that are of interest.  The latter is a feature negotiated
at the time the filter receives a connection from the MTA and its availability
depends upon the version of milter used to compile the filter and the version
of the MTA making the connection.

.TP
.I MacroListVerify (dataset)
Defines a set of MTA-provided
.I macros
that should be checked to see if the sender has been determined to be an
external source and therefore whether or not the message should be signed.
Entries in this data set follow the same form as those of the
.I MacroList
option above.  [this option is not inhereted from OpenDKIM]  

.TP
.I Mode (string)
Selects operating modes.  The string is a concatenation of characters that
indicate which mode(s) of operation are desired.  Valid modes are
.I s
(signer) and
.I v
(verifier).  The default is
.I sv
except in test mode (see the
.I opendkim(8)
man page)
in which case the default is
.I v.
When signing mode is enabled, one of the following combinations must also
be set:
(a) Domain, KeyFile, Selector, no KeyTable, no SigningTable;
(b) KeyTable, SigningTable, no Domain, no KeyFile, no Selector;

TP
.I MinimumKeyBits (integer)
Establishes a minimum key size for acceptable RSA signatures.  Signatures with
smaller key sizes, even if they otherwise pass DKIM validation, will me marked
as invalid.  The default is 1024, which accepts all signatures.  A value of
0 causes the default to be used. Not Applicable to ed25519 signatures.

.TP
.I OmitHeaders (dataset)
Specifies a set of header fields that should be omitted when generating
signatures.  If an entry in the list names any header field that is mandated
by the DKIM specification, the entry is ignored.  A set of header fields is
listed in the DKIM specification (RFC6376, Section 5.4) as "SHOULD NOT" be
signed; the default list for this parameter contains those fields
(Return-Path, Received, Comments, Keywords, Bcc, Resent-Bcc and
DKIM-Signature).  To omit no headers, simply use the string "." (or any
string that will match no header field names).
Specifying a list with this parameter replaces the default entirely, unless
one entry is "*" in which case the list is interpreted as a delta to the
default; for example, "*,+foobar" will use the entire default list plus
the name "foobar", while "*,-Bcc" would use the entire default list except
for the "Bcc" entry. [OmitHeaders NOT IMPLEMENTED - included for reference
only]

.TP 
.I DNSOverride (string)
Provide a text string that a verifying milter should use instead of
consulting the DNS on each message.  This is useful primarily for
testing purposes in environments where it is awkward to modify the
system DNS resolution.  It should not be used in production.

.TP
.I DNSTimeout (integer)
Sets the DNS timeout in seconds.  A value of 0 causes no wait (this is
different than opendkim).  The default is 5.  See also the NOTES section
below.

.TP
.I PeerList (dataset)
Identifies a set of "peers" that identifies clients whose connections
should be accepted without processing by this filter.  The set
should contain on each line a hostname, domain name (e.g. ".example.com"),
IP address, an IPv6 address (including an IPv4 mapped address), or a
CIDR-style IP specification (e.g. "192.168.1.0/24").  An entry beginning
with a bang ("!") character means "not", allowing exclusions of specific
hosts that are otherwise members of larger sets.  Host and domain names are 
matched first, then the IP or IPv6 address depending on the connection 
type.  More precise entries are preferred over less precise ones, i.e. 
"192.168.1.1" will match before "!192.168.1.0/24".  The text form of IPv6 
addresses will be forced to lowercase when queried (RFC5952), so the contents
of this data set should also use lowercase.  The IP address portion of an
entry may optionally contain square brackets; both forms (with and without)
will be checked. [PeerList NOT IMPLEMENTED - included for reference only]

.TP
.I PidFile (string)
Specifies the path to a file that should be created at process start
containing the process ID.  If not specified, no such file will be created.

.TP
.I Selector (string)
Defines the name of the selector to be used when signing messages using RSA.
See the
.B DKIM
specification for details.  Used only when signing with a single key;
see the
.I SigningTable
parameter below for more information.

This parameter is ignored if a
.I KeyTable
is defined.

.TP
.I SelectorEd25519 (string)
Defines the name of the selector to be used when signing messages using Ed25519.
See the
.B DKIM
specification for details.  Used only when signing with a single key;
see the
.I SigningTable
parameter below for more information.

This parameter is ignored if a
.I KeyTableEd25519
is defined.

.TP
.I SignHeaders (dataset)
Specifies the set of header fields that should be included when generating
signatures.  If the list omits any header field that is mandated by the DKIM
specification, those fields are implicitly added.  By default, those fields
listed in the DKIM specification as "SHOULD" be signed (RFC6376, Section 5.4)
will be signed by the filter.  See the
.I OmitHeaders
configuration option for more information about the format and interpretation
of this field.

.TP
.I SigningTable (dataset)

Defines a table used to select a signing identity to apply to a message based on the address found in the From: header field. Keys in this table vary depending on the type of table used; values in this data set should include one field that contains a name found in the KeyTable (see above) that identifies which key should be used in generating the signature, and an optional second field naming the signer of the message that will be included in the "i=" tag in the generated signature. Note that the "i=" value will not be included in the signature if it conflicts with the signing domain (the "d=" value).

If the first field contains only a "%" character, it will be replaced by the domain found in the From: header field. Similarly, within the optional second field, any "%" character will be replaced by the domain found in the From: header field.

If this table specifies a regular expression file ("refile"), then the keys are wildcard patterns that are matched against the address found in the From: header field.  Entries are checked in the order in which they appear in the file.   Note: These are not true regular expressions.  The terminology is inherited from opendkim.  Only wildcards ("*") are supported.

For all other database types, the full user@host is checked first, then simply host, then user@.domain (with all superdomains checked in sequence, so "foo.example.com" would first check "user@foo.example.com", then "user@.example.com", then "user@.com"), then .domain, then user@*, and finally *.

In any case, only the first match is applied.

See the COMPLEX SIGNING CONFIGURATIONS section of README.md for examples.

.TP
.I Socket (string)
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
.I postfix(1)
in order to provide service.
.I socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.I local:path,
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.I path,
or
.I inet:port[@host]
or
.I inet6:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.I port
and in the specified protocol family.  If the
.I host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.  A literal IP address must be enclosed in
square brackets.  This option is mandatory in the configuration file.

.TP
.I SubDomains (Boolean)
Sign subdomains of those listed by the
.I Domain
parameter as well as the actual domains.

.TP
.I Syslog (Boolean)
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
any interesting activity.

.TP
.I SyslogFacility (string)
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
using the named facility.  The facility names are the same as the ones
allowed in
.I syslog.conf(5).
The default is "mail".

.TP
.I SyslogSuccess (Boolean)
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
additional entries indicating successful signing or verification of
messages.

.TP
.I UMask (integer)
Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file creation.
This only really applies to creation of the socket when
.I Socket
specifies a UNIX domain socket, and to the
.I PidFile
(if any); temporary files are created by the
.I mkstemp(3)
function that enforces a specific file mode on creation regardless
of the process umask.  See
.I umask(2)
for more information.

.TP
.I UserID (string)
Attempts to become the specified userid before starting operations.
The value is of the form
.I userid[:group].
The process will be assigned all of the groups and primary group ID of
the named
.I userid
unless an alternate
.I group
is specified.

.SH NOTES
When using DNS timeouts (see the
.I DNSTimeout
option above), be sure not to use a timeout that is larger than the timeout
being used for interaction between
.I sendmail
and the filter.  Otherwise, the MTA could abort a message while waiting for
a reply from the filter, which in turn is still waiting for a DNS reply.  This
must take into accout that the timeout is per DNS lookup so the total DNS wait
time may be subustantially loner than the value specified in
.I DNSTimeout
\.  There is a DNS lookup for each connection if the
.I InternalHosts
option is in use and one for DKIM public key record lookup for each algorithm
per signature per message (i.e. potentially two lookups per signature).
