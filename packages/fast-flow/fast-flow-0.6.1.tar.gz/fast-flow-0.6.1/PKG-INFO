        fast-flow: A YAML-based processing configuration
        ================================================
        Provides a simple interface to describe a processing chain, where a user names
        the stages and type of stage they want to run and then provides specific
        parameters for each stage.
        
        ## Installing

        ## Documentation
        While better documentation is on its way, you might want to look at the examples directory to see how this can be used.
        In addition, the [`fast-carpenter`](https://github.com/fast-hep/fast-carpenter) package makes use of this, so it might be helpful to see how this is used there.
