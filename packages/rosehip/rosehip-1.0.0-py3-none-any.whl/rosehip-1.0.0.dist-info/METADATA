## For developers:

if you want to use it as an .iso you can run [another code I wrote](https://github.com/donno2048/CITUR) but it's currently having some issues, as specified is the [README](https://github.com/donno2048/CITUR/blob/master/README.md)...

or you can either use the [.iso builder](https://github.com/donno2048/CITUR-L) for the [linux version of Rosehip](https://github.com/donno2048/Rosehip-L)
