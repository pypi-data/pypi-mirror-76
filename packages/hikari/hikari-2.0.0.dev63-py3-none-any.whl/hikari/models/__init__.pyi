# This stubfile is generated by Hikari's deploy script as a workaround
# for our design not working correctly with MyPy's --strict flag. By
# explicitly generating this stub, MyPy no longer gets confused by what
# members are re-exported by package level init scripts. This lets you
# type check as strictly as possible and still get correct results.
#
# For all other purposes, you can completely ignore this file!
