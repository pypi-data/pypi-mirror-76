## A standalone server for Anvil full-stack Python web apps.

This package includes several assets, some not in Python:
 - The "anvil-standalone-runtime" script for launching the runtime
 - The "downlink" Python code for the server-side parts of apps
 - The core Anvil server (requires Java to launch)
 - The client-side Anvil runtime (Javascript, using the Skulpt Python-to-JS compiler)

 Head over to [the Github Repository](https://github.com/anvil-works/anvil-runtime) for usage instructions, and to learn more.
