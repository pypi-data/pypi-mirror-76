This is a django-otp plugin that handles `YubiKey
<https://www.yubico.com/yubikey>`_ devices using the Yubico OTP algorithm. This
includes two device definitions: one to verify YubiKey tokens locally and
another to verify them against a `web service
<https://www.yubico.com/yubicloud>`_.

See `django-otp <https://pypi.org/project/django-otp>`_ for more information on
the OTP framework.
