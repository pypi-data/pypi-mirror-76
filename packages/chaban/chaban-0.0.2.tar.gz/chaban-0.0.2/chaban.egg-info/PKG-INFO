Description: # Chaban
        
        Python chat-bot framework. Uses very much concepts from [django](https://github.com/django/django/).
        
        ## Links
        
        - [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/chaban/)
        - [GitHub](https://github.com/ibrag8998/chaban/)
        
        ## Current state
        
        Under heavy development. Chaban supposed to be framework for developing bots for many platforms.
        Now working on telegram bots. Also this project needs to have strong CLI, which is also in development.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```shell
        pip install chaban
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Project structure
        
        To bootstrap a new project, I recommend using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).
        
        ```shell
        pip install cookiecutter
        ```
        
        For now, CLI is not developed, but I hope it will be available soon.
        
        Now, run this command to get your chaban template:
        
        ```shell
        cookiecutter gh:ibrag8998/cookiecutter-chaban
        ```
        
        And answer to the question it asks :D.
        
        The project looks like this:
        
        ```
        project_slug
        +-- project_slug
        |   +-- __init__.py
        |   +-- handlers.py
        |   +-- actions.py
        |   +-- text.py
        +-- settings
        |   +-- __init__.py
        |   +-- base.py
        |   +-- dev.py
        +-- requirements
        |   +-- base.txt
        |   +-- testing.txt
        |   +-- local.txt
        +-- scripts
        |   +-- installdeps.sh
        |   +-- mkenv.sh
        +-- run.py
        +-- ...
        ```
        
        Now run `mkenv.sh` script to make `.env` file which stores some configuration and secret keys:
        
        ```shell
        cd scripts
        ./mkenv.sh
        ```
        
        - `settings/` contains any settings you want, but there some required ones, like `DEBUG`.
        Put base settings in `base.py` and development-only ones in `dev.py`, the rest will be done for you.
        How? Read `settings/__init__.py` file.
        
        - `requirements/` contains separate requirements. `base.txt` are base, project will not work
        without them. `testing.txt` only used for tests. `local.txt` contains requirements for direct developer,
        for example: linter, formatter.
        
        - `scripts/` contains bash scripts to manage your project.
        
        - `run.py` is a file that you will run to start up your bot.
        
        - `project_slug/` is actual core:
        
          - `handlers.py` contains message handlers.
          - `actions.py` contains logic that will be invoked by message handler.
          - `text.py` contains text snippet to send in messages.
        
        ### Settings and config
        
        ### Actual code
        
        First, define a message handler in `handlers.py` like this:
        
        ```python
        from chaban.handlers import CommandMH
        
        class StartCommandMH(CommandMH):
            command = 'start'
        ```
        
        Now, when a message comes, and your handler looks like the message can be handled by it
        (checked by using regex, more info in source code), the `action` will be called. But wait.
        We didn't define any action! Head over to `actions.py` and add one:
        
        ```python
        from chaban.actions import Action
        
        class StartCommandAction(Action):
            def act(self, message: dict) -> None:
                self.tbot.send_message(message['chat']['id'], 'Welcome!')
        ```
        
        Well, action is defined, now let's link the handler with the action.
        Open `handlers.py` file and action attribute like this:
        
        ```python
        ...
        from .actions import StartCommandAction
        
        class StartCommandMH(CommandMH):
            ...
            action = StartCommandAction()
        ```
        
        That's all for basics :D. Now open up your terminal and start bot:
        
        ```shell
        python run.py
        ```
        
        Write to your bot with message "**/start**" and see it works.
