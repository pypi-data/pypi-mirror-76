class FCBFDiscreteFilter(DataChecker):
    """
        Creates FCBF (Fast Correlation Based filter) feature selection filter
        based on mutual information criteria for data with discrete features
        This filter finds best set of features by searching for a feature, which provides
        the most information about classification problem on given dataset at each step
        and then eliminating features which are less relevant than redundant
