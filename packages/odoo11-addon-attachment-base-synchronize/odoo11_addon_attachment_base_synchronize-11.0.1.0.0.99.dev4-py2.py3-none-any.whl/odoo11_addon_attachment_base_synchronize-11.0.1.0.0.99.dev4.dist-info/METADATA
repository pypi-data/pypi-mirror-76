====================
Attachment Metadata
====================

This module extends ir.attachment model with some new fields for a better control for import and export of files.

The main feature is an integrity file check with a hash.

A file hash is short representation (signature) computed from file data.
Hashes computed before send file and after received file can be compared to be sure of the content integrity.

An example of the use of this module, can be found in the module `external_file_location`.


Usage
=====

Go the menu Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Meta Data Attachments

You can create / see standard attachments with additional fields

Configure the batch limit for attachments that can be sync by the cron task at a go:

Settings > Technical > System parameters > attachment_sync_cron_batch_limit
