UI Style Lang (Language)
========================

!["UI Style Lang"](logo.png?raw=true "UI Style Lang")


UI Style Lang is a simple CSS-like language which allows for drawing and styling wxPython elements. Many UI Style Lang properties are the same as the normal (not short-hand) CSS3 properties. This provides a familiar syntax, especially for those with experience with CSS3.
