The Associated Press (AP) Sample Topic Explorer was generated from a collection of 2500 AP articles from the years [1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988), [1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989), and [1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990). This corpus was distributed with the `lda-c` reference implementation ([Blei, 2003](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/lda-c/)) and is a subset of the [TIPSTER Complete Corpus](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93T3A), also known as the [TREC-AP Benchmark Corpus](http://trec.nist.gov/data/docs_eng.html).

The exact model shown here may be replicated on your own machine by [installing the Topic Explorer](http://inphodata.cogs.indiana.edu) and running the command `topicexplorer demo`.
