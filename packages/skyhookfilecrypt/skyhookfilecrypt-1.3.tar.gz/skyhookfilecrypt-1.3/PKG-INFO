Description: # skyhookfilecrypt
        Multithreaded file encryption and decryption module extracted from Skyhook: https://github.com/deedeecx330/skyhook
        
        Designed to be both fast and easy on the resources. 
        
        # Usage
        The module has two functions, encryptFile and decryptFile. The function arguments in both cases are: 
        -   File that is to be encrypted/decrypted
        -   Output file where encrypted/decrypted contents will be saved to
        -   A passphrase to encrypt/decrypt the file with (Can be any primitive data type)
        
        For example
        ```
        skyhookfilecrypt.encryptFile("file.in", "file.out", b"password")
        ```
        will encrypt file.in with the given password and write the encrypted contents of file.in to file.out. Same principle works for decrypting files:
        ```
        skyhookfilecrypt.decryptFile("file.in", "file.out", b"password")
        ```
        will decrypt file.in with the given password and write the decrypted contents to file.out.
