Description: # gistbin
        Github Gist client allowing for quick uploads via commandline. In theory will work like [haste-client](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-client).
        
        ## To Do
        - ~~Get simple version up and running~~
        - ~~create script so it can easily be called from command line~~
        - ~~create `setup.py` so it can be installed via `pip install`~~
        - create PyPi page for it so people can install it
        - make it work on Windows and Mac
