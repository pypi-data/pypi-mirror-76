split_qr_exam
=============

This script splits a pdf composed of scanned exams. The input is a pdf file containing multiple
scanned exames. On each exam cover there should be a QR code identifying the student writing this
exam.
For each part of the exam a folder will be created and for each student a pdf will be created in
that folder to allow for parallel evaluation. To ensure pseudonymity the files are named with the
sha256 hash of the student id.

For this to work, you have to specify all the parts of the exam with the corresponding amount of
pages.

    """Class that handles the scanning of QR codes

    Intended use is creating an instance of the class once, and using it to process all neccessary
    images.

    Attributes:
        threshold: A value between 0 and 255, indicating what amount of grey will be interpreted
                   as black or white. Higher values lead to more black, lower values lead to more
                   white. No threshold will be applied, if the value is None.
        shrink: Shinks the image to this width in the detection phase.
        crop: A tuple of fraction coordinates, representing the area to crop the image to before
              scanning for QR codes. The first element represents the upper left corner of the area
              the second element represents the lower right corner.
              E.g.: ((0,0),(0.5,0.5)) would take the top left quartal of the image,
                    ((0,0.5),(0,1)) would take the left half of the image,
                    ((0.25,0.25), (0.75, 0.75)) would take the center of the image.
              If any value is greater than 1 or less than 0, it will be set to 1 or 0 respectively.

        qr_scanner = QRScanner(127, 600)
