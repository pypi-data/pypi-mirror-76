Description: # fcfuzzy
        
        Fuzzy matching publications for [fatcat](https://fatcat.wiki).
        
        ## Motivation
        
        Most of the results on sites like [Google
        Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=fuzzy+matching) group
        publications into clusters. Each cluster represents one publication, abstracted
        from its concrete representation as a link to a PDF.
        
        We call the abstract publication *work* and the concrete instance a *release*.
        The goal is to group releases under works and to implement a versions feature.
        
        This repository contains both generic code for matching as well as fatcat
        specific code using the fatcat openapi client.
        
        ## Dataset
