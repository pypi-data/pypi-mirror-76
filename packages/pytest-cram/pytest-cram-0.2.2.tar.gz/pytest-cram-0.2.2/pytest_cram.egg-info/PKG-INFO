        pytest-cram: Run cram tests with py.test
        ****************************************
        
        cram_ tests command line applications.
        pytest_ tests Python applications.
        pytest-cram tests Python command line applications
        by letting you write your Python API tests with pytest,
        and your command line tests in cram.
        Best of both worlds!

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install and use pytest-cram, do ::
        
          pip install pytest-cram
        
        pytest-cram works on Python 2.7 and 3.3+
        and with cram_ versions 0.7 and up.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Once installed, all ``.t`` files will be collected
        and run with cram, so installation should be all that is needed.
        
        If you wish to disable cram tests for an invocation of
        pytest, do ::
        
          py.test --nocram
        
        To override the shell used by cram, do ::
        
          py.test --shell="C:\git\bash.exe"
        
        or set the ``CRAMSHELL`` environment variable ::
        
          CRAMSHELL=/bin/bash py.test
        
        If you wish to disable specific cram tests,
        list them in a ``.ini`` file ::
        
          [pytest]
          cramignore = file1.t
              pattern*.t

           - One-line description of change (link to Github issue/PR)

        0.2.2 (2020-08-08)
        ==================
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - Updated for recent pytest changes. (`#13`_)
        
        .. _#13: https://github.com/tbekolay/pytest-cram/pull/13
        
        0.2.1 (2020-05-10)
        ==================
        
        **Fixed**

        0.2.0 (2018-02-06)
        ==================
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - Fixed tests to work with ``pytest>=3.3``. Pytest added progress indicators
          to test output in version 3.3, which the tests were not expecting.
        
        0.1.1 (2016-03-07)
        ==================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added the ``--shell`` command line option and now checks the ``CRAMSHELL``
          environment variable to override the default ``/bin/sh`` shell. (`#3`_)
        
          Thanks to `Florian Rathgeber <https://github.com/kynan>`_ for the contribution!
        
        **Changed**
        
        - Depend explicitly on ``cram>=0.7``. If you would like support for earlier
          versions of cram, please
          `file an issue <https://github.com/tbekolay/pytest-cram/issues/new>`_.
