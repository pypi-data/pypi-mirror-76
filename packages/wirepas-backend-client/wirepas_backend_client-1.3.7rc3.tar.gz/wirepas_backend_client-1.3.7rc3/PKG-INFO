        ## Introduction
        
        The Backend Client is a tool to serve as a decoder and a test framework
        where you can extend the existing interfaces to develop your own test cases.
        Interactions with
        a [gateway][wirepas_gateway] must be compliant with the Wirepas
        Backend to Gateway API.
        
        In addition to the interaction with the Backend to Gateway Public API,
        the Backend Client has also support for Wirepas Positioning Engine and Wirepas
        Network Tool. Support for these tools is still work in progress
        (see [milestones][backend_client_gh_milestones] and [projects][backend_client_gh_projects]).
        However, you can already benefit from existing
        entrypoints to help you capture data and debug your
        integration (see [entrypoints](#entrypoints)).
        
        Figure 1 illustrates the horizon where Backend Client is located.
        
        ![Architecture overview][here_img_overview]
        
        **Figure 1** - Backend Client role in the Wirepas ecosystem.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The Backend Client is written in python and it requires a valid MQTT
        broker target to connect to, WNT or WPE credentials.
        
        If you need help installing a MQTT broker or auxiliary software please
        refer to our tutorials repository.
        
        ### Host dependencies
        
        The main requirements of Backend Client are:
        
        -   Python 3.7
        -   Pip (we recommend the latest available)
        -   Linux system
        
        Certain Backend Client's dependencies must be
        compiled locally upon installation,
        thus require the installation of specific development headers.
        
        Under Debian, the extra requirements are met with:
        
        ```bash
            sudo apt-get install default-libmysqlclient-dev gcc python3.7-dev
            
        ```
        
        Please be advised that the name of such packages might change depending on your
        Linux system. Please refer to the Dockerfiles
        under the [container folder][here_container] for more detailed information.
        
        Windows native environments are not supported. For help running the tool
        in Windows, please use the Linux subsystem, Docker or a virtual machine.
        
        ### Setting up a Python virtual environment
        
        As a recommendation, it is good practice to install and run the
        application on a virtual python environment. Such approach avoids
        possible issues with conflicting package versions.
        
        We recommend you use [pipenv][pipenv]:
        
        ```shell
            pip3 install pipenv
        ```
        
        If you choose to install and run the Backend Client inside a virtual
        environment, please activate the environment before moving with the next
        steps.
        
        For pipenv, a virtual environment is created and activated by:
        
        ```shell
            pipenv --three
            pipenv shell
        ```
        
        Once you activate your environment your can safely install the python
        package under it.
        
        For more information please refer to the tool's webpage.
        
        ### Installing from PyPi
        
        The Backend Client is available from
        [PyPi][backend_client_pypi] and you can install the latest stable version
        with:
        
        ```shell
            pip install wirepas-backend-client
        ```
        
        If you wish to install a particular version please see the release history
        from PyPi.
        
        ### Installing from Github
        
        First of all, make sure to clone the repository using the https address.
        
        Checkout the
        [git tag that corresponds to the release version][backend_client_gh_releases]
        you want to install and install the package with:
        
        ```shell
            pip3 install .
        ```
        
        If you leave your branch checked out to the top of master, it is likely that
        you might run into a few issues. If you find them, please be so kind to
        raise them to us through an [issue or bug report][backend_client_gh_issues].
        
        If you want to develop or patch a bug under your local environment,
        you can install the package in development mode through:
        
        ```shell
            pip3 install -e .
        ```
        
        When installed in development mode, changes to the source files will be
        immediately visible.
        
        ## Entrypoints
        
        After installation, the Backend Client exposes several
        [shell entrypoints][here_setup_entrypoints] that
        can be run from any location in your system. This section describes their
        usage in more detail.
        
        ### Gateway command line interface
        
        The Backend Client exposes an interactive gateway command line which is
        meant to interact with a gateway and sink pair connected to a given
        MQTT broker.
        
        To start an interactive command line to interact with a broker located
        in your _localhost_ environment type:
        
        ```shell
            wm-gw-cli
        ```
        
        Connecting to a remote server requires you to specify the values as an
        argument or by reading from a yaml settings file. To view all the
        arguments, please issue the command:
        
        ```shell
            wm-gw-cli --help
        ```
        
        #### Connecting to the MQTT broker
        
        For the gateway client to function properly, it needs to establish a
        connection to the same MQTT broker where one or multiple gateways
        are connected to.
        
        To do so, let's assume the following MQTT credentials are saved in
        ./examples/settings.yml:
        
        ```yaml
         # examples/settings.yml
         # Example on how to set the MQTT credentials towards a local broker
         # with basic authentication
         mqtt_hostname: 127.0.0.1
         mqtt_password: password
         mqtt_username: username
         mqtt_port: 1883 # defaults to 8883 (secure port)
         mqtt_force_unsecure: True  # defaults to False (secure)
        ```
        
        To start the gateway against the MQTT broker specified in
        ./examples/settings.yml, issue the following command:
        
        ```shell
            wm-gw-cli --settings ./examples/settings.yml
        ```
        
        Once the client launches, you will be greeted with:
        
        ```shell
            Welcome to the Wirepas Gateway Client cli!
            Connecting to mosquittouser@127.0.0.1:1883 (unsecure: True)
        
            Type help or ? to list commands
        
            Type ! to escape shell commands
            Use Arrow Up/Down to navigate your command history
            Use CTRL-D or bye to exit
        
            09:50.17 | wm-gw-cli >
        ```
        
        #### Commands
        
        The gateway client has a set of commands which you can view by typing ?
        in the client's shell:
        
        ```shell
            wm-gw-cli > ?
        
            Documented commands (type help <topic>):
            ========================================
            EOF                     playback           set_loop_iterations
            bye                     q                  set_loop_timeout
            clear_offline_gateways  record             set_reply_greeting
            eof                     scratchpad_status  set_sink
            gateway_configuration   scratchpad_update  settings
            gateways                scratchpad_upload  shell
            help                    selection          sinks
            list                    send_data          toggle_byte_print
            ls                      set_app_config     toggle_pretty_print
            networks                set_config         track_devices
            nodes                   set_gateway        track_data_packets
        ```
        
        For each available command you can get more help if you type
        **?command** for example, to view how to send a datagram,
        type in the shell:
        
        ```shell
            wm-gw-cli > ?send_data
        ```
        
        When typing commands, you can use the up and down arrows to browse your
        shell history. There is also support for running host shell commands, by
        prefacing the command with **!**.
        
        #### Viewing connected devices
        
        Upon a MQTT connection, the Backend Client will start populating an
        internal structure based on any incoming message. The topic is parsed
        and the information about the network devices are constructed.
        
        The operation happens as messages are published from the network. It
        will take time to build a full map of the network, which will be faster
        depending on your network's packets per second.
        
        In case you wish to view periodically which devices you have on your network,
        type in the following command:
        
        ```shell
            wm-gw-cli > ?track_devices
        ```
        
        To exit the tracking loop, give a new line feed to the input stream and
        it will go back to the main command shell.
        
        #### Device settings
        
        When sending a downstream datagram, it is necessary to obey the
        Backend to Gateway API (WM-RM-128).
        For that reason, it is mandatory to know what is the target
        gateway identifier and in most cases the sink id as well.
        
        ##### Selecting the target gateway and sink
        
        The wm-gw-cli provides an easy way to select the target gateway and sink. To
        make your choice, please type the following commands:
        
        ```shell
            wm-gw-cli > set_gateway
            0 : 2485378023427 : GatewayState.ONLINE
            1 : 2485378023426 : GatewayState.OFFLINE
            Please enter your gateway selection [0]: 0
            wm-gw-cli > set_sink
            0 : 3806491:2485378023427:sink0
            Please enter your sink selection [0]: 0
        ```
        
        When setting the gateway, the wm-gw-cli shows you the following information
        _object index : gateway id : state._ Similarly, for the sink, the wm-gw-cli
        presents the object _index : network : gateway id: sink id_.
        
        To make your selection, type the desired object index and press enter.
        
        Once your selection is done, your commands will target that gateway id
        and sink id. If you wish to view what your current selection is, use the
        command:
        
        ```shell
            wm-gw-cli > selection
        ```
        
        :warning: **WARNING** :warning:
        
        The wm-gw-cli prompt will update itself with the current gateway and sink id.
        Throughout this document, that information has been edited out of the
        prompt.
        
        ##### Set app config
        
        Setting the app config requires that your gateway and sink are selected.
        In case you have not done the selection prior to this command, the wm-gw-cli
        will ask for them.
        
        When setting the app config, you are setting three values on the target
        sink:
        
        -   Diagnostic interval: the interval of network diagnostics (0, 30, 60,
            300, 600, 1800)
        
        -   App config: A payload of a given size distributed to all associated
            devices on the network;
        
        -   App config sequence: The sequence of the new app config (must be
            higher than the current one - otherwise the app config won't take
            effect, please refer to WM-RM-100).
        
        The app config payload is given either as a set of binary data without
        trailing 0x or as a utf8 data. For example, to send the
        binary _0x10x40x5_ you should type _010405_.
        If you simply want to have a text string on
        your app config, you can for example type "sink by the window".
        
        As an example, on the wm-gw-cli you would type:
        
        ```shell
            # Remember! no white spaces allowing in the payload!
            # If you want to toggle byte string to hex string in the
            # app_config_data, please see toggle_byte_print

        ```
        
        The answer will carry the gateway result and present you the new app
        config.
        
        ##### Upload and process a scratchpad
        
        The wm-gw-cli supports uploading a new scratchpad and asking the sink to take
        it into use. _A full network OTAP is not currently supported with the
        wm-gw-cli._ To initiate a network OTAP, you will have to send the
        corresponding datagrams as mentioned in the remote API documentation.
        
        The scratchpad commands are available as:
        
        -   scratchpad_status
        -   scratchpad_update
        -   scratchpad_upload
        
        :warning: **WARNING** :warning:
        
        An incorrect scratchpad or an incorrect OTAP can damage your network
        permanently. Please use these commands with care.
        
        ### WPE Viewer
        
        The WPE viewer, _wm-wpe-viewer_, provides a simple way to check
        if a WPE service and consume location updates for a given network.
        
        The WPE viewer entrypoint requires correct population of the following
        settings:
        
        ```yaml
            #examples/settings.yml
            wpe_service_definition: ./mywpesettings.json
            wpe_network: 1092 #optional
        ```
        
        The _mywpesettings.json_ consists of a standard WPE client configuration
        file. Please refer to WPE's official documentation for more details
        on how to obtain and configure such file.
        
        The wpe network is the network identifier on which your devices operate.
        If you leave the parameter unset, the entrypoint will only perform a
        ping to the backend specified under the json file.
        
        ### WNT Viewer
        
        The WNT viewer, _wm-wnt-viewer_, provides a simple way to check
        if a WNT service is reachable and to consume messages streamed by WNT on
        its realtime metadata websocket. These message contain network and node
        diagnostic information. Please refer to WNT's public API documentation
        for further information.
        
        The WNT viewer entrypoint requires correct population of the following
        settings:
        
        ```yaml
            #examples/settings.yml
            wnt_username: "wntuser"
            wnt_password: "98asuyd907171ehjmasd"
            wnt_hostname: "wnthost.com"
        ```
        
        ### Provisioning server
        The provisioning server, _wm-provisioning-server_, provides an example
        implementation of the server side of the provisioning protocol. It must be used
        with the _provisioning_joining_node_ application of the SDK. Please refer to
        the provisioning reference manual for further information.
        
        The Provisioning server entrypoint requires correct population of the following settings:
        
        ```yaml
            #examples/settings.yml
            mqtt_hostname: mqtt_broker_address_or_ip
            mqtt_password: password
            mqtt_username: username
            mqtt_port: 1883 # defaults to 8883 (secure port)
            mqtt_force_unsecure: True  # defaults to False (secure)
        
            provisioning_config: "./myprovisioningconfig.yml"
        ```
        
        The _myprovisioningconfig.yml_ consists of a list of authorized nodes and their
        associated provisioning data.
        
        ## Framework
        
        Besides the useful entrypoints to interact with Wirepas services, the goal of
        the Backend Client is to provide you a framework around which you can
        build test cases to help you during your integration, research and
        development phases.
        
        ### Structure
        
        The framework or package is organized in several submodules:
        
        1.  [api][bcli_api]
            1.  [api/influx][bcli_api_influx]
            2.  [api/mqtt][bcli_api_mqtt]
            3.  [api/mysql][bcli_api_mysql]
            4.  [api/wnt][bcli_api_wnt]
            5.  [api/wpe][bcli_api_wpe]
        2.  [management][bcli_management]
        3.  [mesh][bcli_mesh]
            1.  [mesh/interfaces][bcli_mesh_interfaces]
            2.  [mesh/interfaces/mqtt][bcli_mesh_interfaces_mqtt]
            3.  [mesh/interfaces/remote_api][bcli_mesh_interfaces_remote_api]
            4.  [mesh/interfaces/beacon_api][bcli_mesh_interfaces_beacon_api]
        4.  [messages][bcli_messages]
        5.  [test][bcli_test]
        6.  [tools][bcli_tools]
        7.  [cli](https://github.com/wirepas/backend-client/tree/master/wirepas_backend_client/cli)
        
        #### API submodule
        
        The [api submodule][bcli_api] contains the interfaces to connect
        and handle data coming in and out of Wirepas' services and other
        3rd party services such as databases
        and message brokers.
        
        Each API or interface folder is organized with connectors, handlers and
        settings. The connectors file contains classes to establish a connection to
        the target interface. The handlers contain classes to process streams of input
        and output data. The settings file allows for handling parameter
        translation from input to class arguments (if needed).
        
        #### Management submodule
        
        The [management submodule][bcli_management] contains files regarding
        the runtime management of the framework.
        In particular the daemon which simplifies the multiprocess aspect
        of the Backend Client.
        
        #### Mesh submodule
        
        The [mesh submodule][bcli_mesh] contains files related to how
        devices are mapped within the Backend Client.
        In addition to those, the submodule contains an interfaces
        folder which contains specializations on how to handle specific Wirepas's
        APIs, such as the [Gateway to Backend API][bcli_mesh_interfaces_mqtt].
        
        :pencil2: **NOTE** :pencil2:
        
        In our redesign effort we are targeting to improve the device
        classes and implement remote API support. Please follow the
        framework development for more up to date information.
        
        #### Messages submodule
        
        The [messages submodule][bcli_messages] consists of a collection of
        message handler or decoders that handle translation of known APDUS,
        based on the endpoint they are associated to.
        
        :pencil2: **NOTE** :pencil2:
        
        We are considering moving the message handlers into the overarching Wirepas
        Backend APIs project. Please follow the framework development for more up to
        date information.
        
        #### Test submodule
        
        The [test submodule][bcli_test] contains classes to handle internal task
        scheduling and scripts to address particular mesh use cases.
        
        #### Tools submodule
        
        The [tools submodule][bcli_tools] contains a collection of files
        with classes that handle the acquisition of user
        input, setup of the logging interface and general
        purpose utility methods and classes.
        
        #### Cli submodule
        
        Currently still a [single file][wm_gw_cli], this upcoming submodule
        will contain a re-factor of the gateway client to allow easier
        customization and construction of custom command line interfaces.
        
        ## Logging to fluentd
        
        The Backend Client has integrated logging with fluentd through Python's
        logging facility.
        
        Routing data to a fluentd host requires that you define the target host
        when executing a Backend Client script.
        
        To configure the target host, tag and record for the stream, ensure that
        you configure the examples/settings.yml file with
        
        ```yaml
            # tags stream with app.mesh
            fluentd_hostname: "myfluenthost"
            fluentd_record: mesh
            fluentd_tag: app
        ```
        
        ## Building and running over Docker
        
        Docker allows application to run on a sandbox containing
        all the dependencies needed to run and execute them.
        If you are not familiar with Docker, please refer to the
        official documentation at [docker.com][docker].
        
        ### Dockerhub
        
        Backend Client builds are available
        from dockerhub under the [Backend Client registry][backend_client_dockerhub].
        
        The latest tag points to the current stable release,
        whereas the edge tag points to the top of master.
        
        The latest tag is built automatically at dockerhub whenever this repository
        is tagged.
        
        The edge tag is built after each single merge into master.
        
        To pull the Backend Client image from dockerhub use:
        
        ```shell
            docker pull wirepas/backend-client:latest
            docker pull wirepas/backend-client:<tag>
        ```
        
        ### Running with docker
        
        As the container will have no access to your local environment, you will have
        to propagate the input parameters by mounting a local file inside the
        container,eg, _examples/settings.yml_.
        
        The default image command will launch the gateway client with the settings
        present under _/home/wirepas/vars/settings.yml_ (container path).
        
        To run it with docker type
        
        ```shell
            docker run -it \
                       -v $(pwd)/examples/settings.yml:/home/wirepas/backend-client/vars/settings.yml \
                       --net=host \
                       wirepas/backend-client \
                       wm-gw-cli \
                       --settings /home/wirepas/backend-client/vars/settings.yml \
                       --debug_level=critical
        ```
        
        :warning: **WARNING** :warning:
        
        If you want to run against a MQTT running in your host (localhost),
        you must overlay the container over your host's network.
        To do so, you must set the docker run parameter _--net=host._
        
        ### Running with compose
        
        To run the Backend Client using docker compose, drop or move the settings
        file in **container/examples/settings.yml** and start the service with:
        
        ```shell
            docker-compose container/docker-compose.yml up
        ```
        
        By default this will start the [MQTT viewer example][examples_mqtt_viewer].
        
        If you wish to run the gateway command client you can do so with:
        
        ```shell
            docker-compose -f container/docker-compose.yml \
                           run \
                           backend-client wm-gw-cli \
                           --settings /home/wirepas/backend-client/vars/settings.yml
        ```
        
        If you prefer alpine based images, please change _slim_ to _alpine_.
        
        ### Building the image locally
        
        To build the image locally in the root of the repo type:
        
        ```shell
            docker build -f container/slim/Dockerfile -t backend-client .
        ```
        
        Alternatively you can also build using the docker-compose.yml present in
        the root of the directory:
        
        ```shell
            docker-compose -f container/docker-compose.yml  build
        ```
