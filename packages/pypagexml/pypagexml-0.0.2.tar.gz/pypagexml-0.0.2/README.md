python implementation of pagexml format
=======================================

This library implements the [PRImA PAGE XML][1] layout format. High-level
functions are provided for parts relevant to basic segmentation, the rest of
the format is accessible via code generated by [generateDS][2], with some added
type annotations.

This is mostly created to suit the needs of ocr4all-pixel-classifier, other
features may be added in the future.
