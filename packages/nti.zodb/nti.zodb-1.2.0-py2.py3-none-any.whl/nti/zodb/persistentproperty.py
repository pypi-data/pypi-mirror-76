    Lets you assign to a property without necessarily changing the
    ``_p_status`` of this object.

    In a subclass of :class:`persistent.Persistent`, the
    ``__setattr__`` method sets ``_p_changed`` to True when called
    with a ``name`` argument that does not start with ``_p_``
    (properties of the persistent object itself) or ``_v_`` (volatile
    properties). This makes it hard to use with conflict-reducing
    objects like :class:`nti.zodb.minmax.NumericMaximum`: instead of
    being able to define a descriptor to access and mutate them
    directly, you must remember to go through their API, and replacing
    existing simple attributes (a plain number) with a property
    doesn't actually reduce conflicts until all callers have been
    updated to use the API.

    This superclass fixes that problem. When :meth:`__setattr__` is
    called, it checks to see if the underlying attribute is actually a
    descriptor extending :class:`PropertyHoldingPersistent`, and if
    so, delegates directly to that object. That object is responsible
    for managing the persistent state of that instance.

    .. caution::

        When you subclass this, you should not modify the type after
        the first instance is constructed by adding new
        :class:`PropertyHoldingPersistent` instances. As an
        implementation note, the ``__new__`` method caches the
        properties that are ``PropertyHoldingPersistent``. Adding new
        ones will bypass the cache (and make the instance modified)
        but otherwise still behave correctly. Replacing one with a
        different type of property or deleting the property altogether
        may not function correctly.
