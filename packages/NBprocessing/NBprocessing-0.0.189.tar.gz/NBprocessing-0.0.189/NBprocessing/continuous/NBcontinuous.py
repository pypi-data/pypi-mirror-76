"""
Generic functions to manipulate continuous features in pandas data frame.

This library include the functions:
    1. fill_na_timedate(database, column_name):
        Fill all the missing values in a time-date column with the mean time of the column.

    2. remove_outliers_by_boundaries(database, column_name, bot_qu, top_qu):
        Remove outliers values from column by top and bottom boundaries.
        Before removing the indexes will print a message to the user with the number of indexes that
        will be remove and the percent of the database that will be lost.
        the user will input 'y'(yes) to pressed and 'n'(no) to cancel the action.
        If the user choose 'yes' the method will continue to drop the indexes and will
        plot the new database shape.

    3. get_num_outliers_by_value(database, filter_dict_up, filter_dict_down):
        Prints how many indexes are above the values in the 'filter_dict_up' dictionary and how many indexes are below
        The values in the 'filter_dict_down' dictionary.
        The dictionary keys are the column names while the values are the top/ bottom boundaries.
        Will not conduct the action on all columns - only on columns in keys.

    4. remove_outliers_by_value(database, filter_dict_up, filter_dict_down):
        remove all indexes that are above the values in the 'filter_dict_up' dictionary and indexes that are below
        The values in the 'filter_dict_down' dictionary.
        The dictionary keys are the column names while the values are the top/ bottom boundaries.
        Will not conduct the action on all columns - only on columns in keys.

def remove_outliers_by_boundaries(database, column_name, bot_qu, top_qu):
    """
    Remove outliers values from column by top and bottom boundaries.

    The theory behind it:
    the number of outliers  will follow a binomial distribution with parameter p, which can generally be
    well-approximated by the Poisson distribution with λ = pn. Thus if one takes a normal distribution with
    cutoff 3 standard deviations from the mean, p is approximately 0.3%, and thus for 1000 trials one can
    approximate the number of samples whose deviation exceeds 3 sigmas by a Poisson distribution with λ = 3.
    3 times of standard deviation as my main data and out of this range would be the outlier.

    Thus, in a normal distribution the top and bottom boundaries should contain 99.7% of the data.
    However, not all data has Normal distribution thus the user is able to change the top and bottom boundaries

    Before removing the indexes will print a message to the user with the number of indexes that
    will be remove and the percent of the database that will be lost.
    the user will input 'y'(yes) to pressed and 'n'(no) to cancel the action.
    If the user choose 'yes' the method will continue to drop the indexes and will
    plot the new database shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    :param database: pandas Data Frame
    data set to remove outliers from.

    :param column_name: string
    The name of the column to preform the check.
    the data type must be numeric

    :param bot_qu: float, 0 < bot_qu < 1
     bottom boundary to remove outliers from - percent in fraction

    :param top_qu: float, 0 < top_qu < 1
     upper boundary to remove outliers from - percent in fraction
