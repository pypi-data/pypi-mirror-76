fat-ffipd is a basic flask template that includes a basic authentication system
wth API support, as well as a default layout that incorporates them.

It's meant to be a starting point for a flask app.

Also incorporated are docker and docker-compose files that make setting up a
website rather simple.

# Usage

To convert this project into a new one, run ```init.py``` and follow the
prompts. This will set up the project in a new directory, defined by the
project name given during prompting.

To start the web application, you can simply call ```python server.py``` after
installing it using ```python setup.py install```.

To run the application in docker, make sure all necessary environment
variables are stored in the ```.env``` file. Also make sure that the
```HTTP_PORT``` and ```DEPLOY_MODE``` environment variables are set.
If this is the case, simply run ```docker-compose up -d``` to start the
application.
