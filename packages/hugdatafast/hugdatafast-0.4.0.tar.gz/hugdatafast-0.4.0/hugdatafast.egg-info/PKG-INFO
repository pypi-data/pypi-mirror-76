        # Install
        `pip install hugdatafast`
        
        # Furture Plan
        - I will try to merge this library to fastai2 and huggingface/nlp respectively. But to not introduce bugs into the two great libraries and for fast development, I may try it after my personal project which hugdatafast is created for, is completed (few months later I think), to somewhat assure it is mature enough to be merged into two libraries.
        - The implemenatation of `ConcatTransform` works but might be too complexed to extend, so I may discuss with huggingface to see how to improve it, if I have time.
        - Currently, it is designed to work with the dataset part of huggingface/nlp, I may also integrate metric part of it.
