Description: # libdct: A library for audio processing by Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
        
        ### The library is to facilitate audio processing with  Discrete Cosine Transform. 
        
        DCT are the kind of transforms that avoid doing signal process in complex Fourier space. 
        Since most deep networks are difficult to capture relations in complext space, DCT are good choices for extacting audio features or generating audio signal using deep learning
