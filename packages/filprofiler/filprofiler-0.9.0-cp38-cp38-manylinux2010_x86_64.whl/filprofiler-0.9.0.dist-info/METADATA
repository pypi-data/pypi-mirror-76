# The Fil memory profiler for Python

Fil a memory profiler designed for data processing applications.
At the moment it only runs on Linux and macOS.

Your code reads some data, processes it, and—uses too much memory.
What you need to reduce is _peak_ memory usage.

And that's exactly what Fil will help you find: exactly which code was responsible for allocating memory at _peak_ memory usage.

For more information see https://pythonspeed.com/products/filmemoryprofiler/

## What Fil tracks

Fil will track memory allocated by:

* Normal Python code.
* C code using `malloc()`/`calloc()`/`realloc()`/`posix_memalign()`.
* C++ code using `new` (including via `aligned_alloc()`).
* Anonymous `mmap()`s.
* Fortran 90 explicitly allocated memory (tested with gcc's `gfortran`).

Still not supported, but planned:

* `mremap()` (resizing of `mmap()`).
* File-backed `mmap()`.
  The usage here is inconsistent since the OS can swap it in or out, so probably supporting this will involve a different kind of resource usage.
* Other forms of shared memory, need to investigate if any of them allow sufficient allocation.
* Anonymous `mmap()`s created via `/dev/zero` (not common, since it's not cross-platform, e.g. macOS doesn't support this).
* `memfd_create()`.
* Possibly `memalign`, `valloc()`, `pvalloc()`, `reallocarray()`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To install the latest version of Fil you'll need Pip 19 or newer.
You can check like this:

```
$ pip --version
pip 20.0.2
```

If you're using something older than that, do:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

If _that_ doesn't work, try running that a virtualenv or Conda env.

### Installing Fil

Assuming you're on macOS or Linux, and are using Python 3.6 or later:

```
$ pip install filprofiler
```

## Measuring peak (high-water mark) memory usage

Instead of doing:

```
$ python yourscript.py --input-file=yourfile
```

Just do:

```
$ fil-profile run yourscript.py --input-file=yourfile
```

And it will generate a report.

## Debugging out-of-memory crashes

First, run `free` to figure out how much memory is available—in this case about 6.3GB—and then set a corresponding limit on virtual memory with `ulimit`:

```shell
$ free -h
       total   used   free  shared  buff/cache  available
Mem:   7.7Gi  1.1Gi  6.3Gi    50Mi       334Mi      6.3Gi
Swap:  3.9Gi  3.0Gi  871Mi
$ ulimit -Sv 6300000
```

Then, run your program under Fil, and it will generate a SVG at the point in time when memory runs out:

```shell
$ fil-profile run oom.py 
...
=fil-profile= Wrote memory usage flamegraph to fil-result/2020-06-15T12:37:13.033/out-of-memory.svg
```

## You've found where memory usage is coming from—now what?
