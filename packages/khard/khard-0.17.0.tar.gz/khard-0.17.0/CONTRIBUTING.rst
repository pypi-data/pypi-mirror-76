Khard is developed on `Github`_ where you are welcome to post `bug reports`_,
`feature requests`_ or join the discussion in general.

Bug reports
-----------

If you want to report a bug keep in mind that the following things make it much
easier for maintainers to help:

- update to the latest version if possible and verify the bug there
- report the version(s) that are affected
- state the python version you are using
- if there are stack tracebacks post them with your bug report
- supply a minimal configuration (config file and vcards) to reproduce the
  error

Feature requests
----------------

Please stick to the following standards when you open pull requests:

- Khard's development tries to follow `Vincent's branching model`_ so normal
  pull requests should be made against the `develop`_ branch. Only important
  bug fixes that affect the current release should be opened against `master`_.
- Write "good" commit messages, especially a proper subject line.  This is also
  explained in `the Git book`_.
- Format your python code according to `PEP 8`_.  Tools like `pylint`_ also
  help in writing maintainable code.
- Khard has a test suite, please provide tests for bugs that you fix and also
  for new code and new features that are introduced.
- Please verify *all* tests pass before sending a pull request, they will be
  checked again by travis but it might be a lot faster to check locally first:

Development
-----------

In order to start coding you need to fetch the develop branch:

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/scheibler/khard
  cd khard
  python setup.py build  # to generate the version.py file
  python -m khard --help
  # or
  pip3 install --editable .
  khard --help

Alternatively you can use the ``setup.py`` script directly.  If you want to
isolate khard from your system Python environment you can use a `virtualenv`_
to do so.
