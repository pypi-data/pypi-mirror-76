# ODI Token Contracts

OpenDevICON Token Contracts implement IRC2 standard token which is equivalent to [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) for [ICON](https://icon.foundation/?lang=en) blockchain. It helps to keep track of [fungible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) tokens.

There are a few core contracts to implement IRC2 token.

-   [IIRC2](https://github.com/icon-project/IIPs/blob/master/IIPS/iip-2.md): Interface IRC2 methods should confirm into.
-   [IRC2](https://docs.opendevicon.io/v/development/score-library/irc2standard): The base implementation of IRC2 contract.

This has been extended to implement the following.

-   [IRC2Mintable](https://docs.opendevicon.io/v/development/score-library/irc2standard/irc2mintable): To create token supply.
-   [IRC2Capped](https://docs.opendevicon.io/v/development/score-library/irc2standard/irc2capped): Total supply cannot exceed the cap amount.
-   [IRC2Burnable](https://docs.opendevicon.io/v/development/score-library/irc2standard/irc2burnable): To destroy the tokens.
-   [IRC2Pausable](https://docs.opendevicon.io/v/development/score-library/irc2standard/irc2pausable): To pause token operation for all users.
-   [IRC2Snapshot](https://docs.opendevicon.io/v/development/score-library/irc2standard/irc2snapshot): To add snapshot mechanism.
