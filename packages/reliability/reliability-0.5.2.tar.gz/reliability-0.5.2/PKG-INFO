        *reliability* is a Python library for reliability engineering and survival analysis. It significantly extends the functionality of scipy.stats and also includes many specialist tools that are otherwise only available in proprietary software.

        ## Key features
        - Fitting probability distributions to data including right censored data
        - Fitting Weibull mixture models
        - Calculating the probability of failure for stress-strength interference between any combination of the supported distributions
        - Support for Exponential, Weibull, Gamma, Normal, Lognormal, and Beta probability distributions
        - Mean residual life, quantiles, descriptive statistics summaries, random sampling from distributions
        - Plots of probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), survival function (SF), hazard function (HF), and cumulative hazard function (CHF)
        - Easy creation of distribution objects. Eg. dist = Weibull_Distribution(alpha=4,beta=2)
        - Non-parametric estimation of survival function using Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen
        - Goodness of fit tests (AICc, BIC)
        - Probability plots on probability paper for all supported distributions
        - Quantile-Quantile plots and Probability-Probability plots
        - Reliability growth, optimal replacement time, sequential sampling charts, similar distributions
        - Physics of Failure (SN diagram, stress-strain, fracture mechanics, creep)
        - Accelerated Life Testing probability plots (Weibull, Exponential, Normal, Lognormal)
        - Accelerated Life Testing Models (Exponential, Eyring, Power, Dual-Exponential, Power-Exponential).
        - Mean cumulative function for repairable systems
