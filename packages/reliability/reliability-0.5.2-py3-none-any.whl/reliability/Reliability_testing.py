Reliability_testing

This is a collection of several statistical tests and reliability test planners.
Included functions are:
one_sample_proportion - Calculates the upper and lower bounds of reliability for a given number of trials and successes.
two_proportion_test - Calculates whether the difference in test results between two samples is statistically significant.
sample_size_no_failures - used to determine the sample size required for a test in which no failures are expected, and the desired outcome is the lower bound on the reliability based on the sample size and desired confidence interval.
sequential_sampling_chart - plots the accept/reject boundaries for a given set of quality and risk levels. If supplied, the test results are also plotted on the chart.
reliability_test_planner - Finds the lower confidence bound on MTBF for a given test duration, number of failures, and specified confidence interval.

    Solves for unknown test planner variables, given known variables.
    The Chi-squared distribution is used to find the lower confidence bound on MTBF for a given test duration, number of failures, and specified confidence interval.
    The equation for time-terminated tests is: MTBF = (2*test_duration)/(chisquared_inverse(CI, 2*number_of_failures+2))
    The equation for failure-terminated tests is: MTBF = (2*test_duration)/(chisquared_inverse(CI, 2*number_of_failures))
    This equation can be rearranged to solve for any of the 4 variables. For example, you may want to know how many failures you are allowed to have in a given test duration to achieve a particular MTBF.
    The user must specify any 3 out of the 4 variables (not including two_sided, print_results, or time_terminated) and the remaining variable will be calculated.

    Inputs:
    MTBF - mean time between failures. This is the lower confidence bound on the MTBF. Units given in same units as the test_duration.
    number_of_failures - the number of failures recorded (or allowed) to achieve the MTBF. Must be an integer.
    test_duration - the amount of time on test required (or performed) to achieve the MTBF. May also be distance, rounds fires, cycles, etc. Units given in same units as MTBF.
    CI - the confidence interval at which the lower confidence bound on the MTBF is given. Must be between 0.5 and 1. For example, specify 0.95 for 95% confidence interval.
    print_results - True/False. Default is True.
    two_sided - True/False. Default is True. If set to False, the 1 sided confidence interval will be returned.
    time_terminated - True/False. Default is True. If set to False, the formula for the failure-terminated test will be used.

    Outputs:
    If print_results is True, all the variables will be printed.
    An output object is also returned with the same values as the inputs and the remaining value also calculated.
